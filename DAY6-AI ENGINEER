Post Draft:
Day 6/100: Sick But Still Coding ðŸ’»ðŸ¤’

Today was TOUGH. I woke up feeling super illâ€”fever, headache, the works. ðŸ˜·

Iâ€™ll admit, I felt ashamed that I couldnâ€™t keep up with my usual pace. But hereâ€™s the thing: progress isnâ€™t linear. Some days youâ€™re unstoppable; other days, your body says "nope." And thatâ€™s okay.

Instead of forcing myself to grind, I adjusted my goals and built 5 mini Python projects (while wrapped in a blanket ðŸ§£). Small wins count!

âœ… Simple Calculator (User input, conditionals)
âœ… Number Guessing Game (Random module, loops)
âœ… Multiplication Table Generator (For loops)
âœ… Rock-Paper-Scissors (Game logic, loops)
âœ… To-Do List App (Lists, user interaction)

Lesson learned:
ðŸ“Œ Rest is part of the process.
ðŸ“Œ Showing upâ€”even imperfectlyâ€”beats quitting.

Tomorrow, Iâ€™ll be back stronger. ðŸ’ª
