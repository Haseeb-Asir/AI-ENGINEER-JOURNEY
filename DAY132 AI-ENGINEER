Day 132 of my AI Engineer Journey
It took me 7 days to fully understand gradient descent.
Worth it. Challenging. Eye-opening.
But ultimately... nobody tells you about the 3D visualization that makes everything click.
Most people learn gradient descent like this:
→ "Here's the formula for updating parameters."
→ "Trust the math, it finds the minimum."
→ "Just apply it to your linear regression problem."
But anyone who's actually mastered it knows the real learning happens in 3D space.
What 7 days of gradient descent taught me?
The complete picture nobody shows you:

Day 126: Single parameter (B only) - learned the basics
Day 127-128: Added learning rate tuning - saw the zigzag problem
Day 129-130: Mathematical implementation - built from scratch
Day 131: 4-graph visualization - watched convergence happen
Day 132: Complete solution (M + B together) - the full algorithm

Today's breakthrough:
Finally implemented gradient descent for BOTH M and B simultaneously:
B_new = B_old - learning_rate * slope_B
M_new = M_old - learning_rate * slope_M
The 3D reality I discovered:

Convex loss surface: Beautiful bowl shape → guaranteed global minimum
Non-convex surface: Hills and valleys → can get trapped in local minima
Data scaling impact: Scaled data = smooth descent, unscaled = chaotic path

What the visualization showed:

Parameters dancing around the loss surface
Gradual descent toward the optimal point
Why learning rate matters (big steps = overshooting)

The truth?
7 days felt long, but gradient descent is the foundation of EVERYTHING in ML.
Every neural network, every deep learning model - they all use this same principle.
Tomorrow: Moving beyond linear regression to real ML algorithms.
Master the fundamentals completely.
Then everything else becomes easier.
Question: How long did it take you to truly "get" your first ML algorithm? Was it worth the time investment?
