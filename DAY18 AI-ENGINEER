# 🎉 **Python Learning Journey - Completed!** 🚀

## ✅ **Day 18: Python Done!**

After 18 days of consistent effort, I’m thrilled to say that I have **completed Python**! 🐍  
This has been an amazing journey where I've learned and implemented various important concepts:

### Topics Covered:
- **Data Types, Loops, Functions, OOP**  
- **File Handling, Modules, Exception Handling**  
- **Multi-threading, Multi-processing, Asyncio/await**  
- **Data Structures like Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets**

Today, **April 27, 2025**, marks a big milestone where I wrap up the core Python concepts. 📖💻

## 🔄 **What’s Next?**
For the next 2–3 days, I will:
- **Revise key Python concepts** 🧠
- **Build small projects** to apply everything learned 🛠️
- Strengthen problem-solving skills

After that, I will dive into **Data Analysis** using **Pandas, NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**! 📊
