Day 152 of my AI Engineer Journey
Today's implementation:
I discovered ensemble learning and realized why it dominates 95% of ML competitions.
The process:

Learned "wisdom of crowds" principle in ML context
Studied how multiple models combine for better performance
Explored the famous crowd weight-guessing experiment
Practiced more stack problems and pattern recognition

What I learned:

Ensemble = Multiple models working together as one big model
Historical proof: Crowd's average guess was exactly correct when individuals were wrong
Two combination methods:

Classification: Majority voting
Regression: Mean of predictions



Ensemble requirements:

Models must be different (different algorithms OR same algorithm on different data)
Example: SVM + Logistic Regression + Decision Tree working together

The four main types:

Voting: Simple majority/average
Bagging: Includes Random Forest
Boosting: AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost
Stacking: Advanced meta-learning approach

Key insight:
Ensemble learning smooths out individual model noise and reduces both bias and variance simultaneously.
Why it works:
Multiple perspectives capture different patterns in data, creating robustness against overfitting.
DSA practice:
Continued stack problems focusing on pattern recognition and string manipulation.
Tomorrow: Deep dive into bagging and Random Forest implementation.
Multiple weak models often beat one strong model.
Diversity creates strength.
Question: Have you noticed that group decisions often outperform individual expert opinions in your field?
