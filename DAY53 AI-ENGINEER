🚀 Day 53: Statistics Meets EDA — The Foundation of Feature Engineering
Today I continued my journey in Math for AI and explored concepts that are directly connected to feature engineering and data analysis.

📘 Key Concepts I Covered:
📍 Standard Deviation (σ)
Measures how spread out the data is.

Most used because it has the same unit as the data, making interpretation easier.

📌 σ = √variance

📍 Coefficient of Variation (CV%)
Formula: (Standard Deviation / Mean) * 100

Helps compare variability between datasets with different units or means.

📊 Graphs for Data Analysis:
🔹 For Categorical Data
Frequency Distribution Table → Bar Plot

Relative Frequency Table → Pie Chart

Cumulative Frequency → Line Graph (running total)

🔹 For Numerical Data
Binning into intervals like 10–20, 20–30, etc.

Used in Histograms to visualize distributions (symmetric, skewed, bimodal, etc.)

🔍 Bivariate Analysis Scenarios:
Both Columns Categorical → Crosstab / Contingency Table

Both Columns Numerical → Scatter Plot

One Categorical, One Numerical → Compare distributions using bar plots or grouped box plots

🎯 Reflection:
All of these are core to EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) — and it’s becoming clear how Statistics is not just theory but a vital tool for understanding and preparing data in real-world AI/ML workflows.

🧠 "If you're serious about AI or data science, learn statistics before diving into models."

📅 Day 53 done. Learning every day — one concept at a time.
