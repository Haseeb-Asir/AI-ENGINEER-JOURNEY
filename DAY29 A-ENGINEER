🚀 Day 29 of #100DaysOfAI
Today was all about building a strong foundation in Pandas and NumPy ufuncs.

Here's what I learned today:

📘 Pandas

What Pandas is and why it's essential for data analysis

How to work with Series and DataFrames

Reading data from CSV and JSON files

Basic data analysis using built-in functions

A brief intro to cleaning data – including handling missing values and formatting

📗 NumPy ufuncs (Universal Functions)

What ufuncs are and how they provide fast, element-wise operations

Learned about:

Simple arithmetic operations

Rounding decimals

Summations and differences

Logs, trigonometric, hyperbolic functions

Finding LCM and GCD

Set operations with NumPy arrays

📂 I used the W3Schools CSV dataset to explore these concepts and understand how they apply to real-world data.

⏳ I didn’t get to practice everything in depth yet, but learning how these tools work has really helped me connect the dots between data and logic.

🔄 Excited to move forward into deeper data cleaning and analysis in the coming days!
