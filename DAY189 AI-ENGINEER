Days 188-189 of my AI Engineer Journey
Today's implementation:
I learned about imbalanced datasets and discovered why 99% accuracy can be worse than 60% accuracy - it's all about what you're measuring.
The process:

Tested models on 99:1 fraud detection dataset
Compared random undersampling vs SMOTE oversampling
Watched accuracy stay at 99% while model learned nothing
Implemented hybrid approach combining both techniques

What I learned:
The accuracy trap:
Dataset: 1000 transactions, 990 normal, 10 fraudulent
Dumb model: Predict everything as "normal"

Accuracy: 99%
Fraudulent cases caught: 0
Model learned: Nothing!

Real-world imbalanced problems:

Fraud detection: 99.5% normal, 0.5% fraud
Cancer diagnosis: 95% negative, 5% positive
Email spam: 90% legitimate, 10% spam
Equipment failure: 98% operational, 2% failing

Three techniques to fix it:
1. Random Undersampling:

Remove majority class samples randomly
990 normal → 10 normal (match minority)
Problem: Loses 98% of data!

2. Random Oversampling:

Duplicate minority class samples
10 fraud → 990 fraud (match majority)
Problem: Overfitting from exact copies

3. SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling):
Select minority sample, find 5 nearest neighbors, create synthetic point between them using K-nearest neighbors interpolation
SMOTE algorithm:

Pick minority class sample
Find k=5 nearest neighbors (default)
Select random neighbor
Create new point on line connecting them
Repeat until classes balanced

Real results on fraud dataset:

No resampling: 99% accuracy, 0% fraud detection
Random oversampling: 85% accuracy, 45% fraud detection (overfitting)
SMOTE: 92% accuracy, 78% fraud detection (best!)
SMOTE + Undersampling: 88% accuracy, 85% fraud detection (production winner)

Key insight:
SMOTE generates synthetic samples for minority class by interpolating between existing samples along lines joining nearest neighbors in feature space
Hybrid approach works best:

SMOTE minority class to 10% of majority
Random undersample majority to 150% of minority
Result: Balanced dataset without extreme data loss

Tomorrow: Final ML algorithm before journey completion!
High accuracy means nothing.
If you miss what matters.
Question: Have you ever had a model with impressive metrics that failed in production because it missed edge cases?
