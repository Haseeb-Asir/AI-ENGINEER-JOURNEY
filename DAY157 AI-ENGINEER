Days 156-159 of my AI Engineer Journey
Reality check:
Apartment shifting consumed these 4 days completely. No coding. No learning. Just boxes, logistics, and exhaustion.
What happened:

Days 156-159: Full apartment move
Zero ML implementation
Zero DSA practice
Complete focus on life logistics

What I'm NOT doing:

Pretending I studied during chaos
Making excuses about "reviewing concepts"
Claiming I learned anything technical

What I learned instead:

Project management under pressure
Resource allocation in real scenarios
Dealing with unexpected delays and constraints

The honest truth:
Sometimes life demands 100% attention. Pretending to maintain learning streaks during major disruptions is performative, not productive.
Back to full schedule:

Day 160 onwards: Resuming bagging and Random Forest
Fresh start with full focus
No guilt about the break

Tomorrow: Diving back into ensemble learning - bagging implementation and Random Forest from scratch.
Taking real breaks is better than fake consistency.
Quality learning beats streak maintenance.
Question: Do you think it's better to take complete breaks during major life events or force partial learning to maintain streaks?
