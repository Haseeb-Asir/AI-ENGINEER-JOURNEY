Day 51/112 – A tough day.

Today hit differently.

Lost a cousin suddenly — it’s hard to find the right words for moments like these. The shock, the sadness... it’s real.

But somehow, in the silence that followed, I also felt this deep urge to keep going. Life is unpredictable, fragile, and short. And that’s why I want to make mine meaningful — for myself and for those who are no longer with us.

I’m still learning. Still building. Still showing up.

Rest in peace, my cousin. 🕊️
Your memory is a quiet push to keep going. 🤍
