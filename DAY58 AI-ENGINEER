Day 58 NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS 🎯
I realized I'm not here to post just for the sake of it. Here's something useful I learned today:
📊 How CDF Helps in Data Science:
The Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) shows how much probability lies below a point.
 In model evaluation, we use it to decide how accurate we want to be — e.g., “what’s the cutoff for top 95% of predictions?”
🔍 2D Density Plots:
Think of them as viewing a mountain from above — darker areas = more data density.
 Used to visualize relationships between two continuous variables.
📈 Normal Distribution:
Bell-shaped, symmetric, common in nature
Defined by mean (center) and std deviation (spread)
Area under curve = 1
Use Z = (x - μ)/σ to standardize → compare any values using Z-tables
 Follow the Empirical Rule:
 68% within 1σ, 95% within 2σ, 99.7% within 3σ
I understood why normal distribution is super important in all fields and in Stats.Learning it is necesssary fr.
