📘 Day 72 ANOVA TEST:

Today, I took a deeper dive into one of the most powerful tools in statistics: ANOVA (Analysis of Variance). It's more than just comparing averages — it’s about understanding how multiple factors influence results, both individually and together.

🎯 What I Learned:

✅ One-Way ANOVA

 → Used when there's one factor with multiple groups

 Example: Testing if different fertilizers affect crop yield.

 Only one variable (fertilizer type), but multiple levels (A, B, C)

✅ Two-Way ANOVA

 → Used when we test the impact of two independent variables, and their interaction

 Example: How training method and gender affect test scores.

 I learned how to not just test if each factor has an effect — but if they influence each other.

📊 Also learned how:

Between-group vs Within-group variance drives the F-value

Post-hoc tests like Tukey’s help figure out which groups differ

Python’s statsmodels makes implementation clean and powerful

🧠 Key Takeaway:

ANOVA isn’t just a statistical test — it’s a way of asking smarter questions:

 “Are these differences real?”

 “Which factor matters more?”

 “Do combinations of factors behave differently?”
