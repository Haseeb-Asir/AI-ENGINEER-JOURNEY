Day 56 of AI Engineer Journey ðŸŒ™

Eid Mubarak to everyone celebrating around the world! ðŸ’«

Itâ€™s not the sacrifice of an animal that reaches Allah, but the taqwa (piety and sincerity) behind it. ðŸŒ¸ Letâ€™s reflect, reconnect, and renew our intentions â€” not just in faith, but in everything we do.

Taking a short pause today for Eid celebrations. Iâ€™ll continue my journey on June 10 inshaAllah.

Wishing everyone peace, progress, and purpose â€” whether you're learning AI, coding, or just trying to become 1% better each day. ðŸ’»ðŸ’¡

See you all soon â€” with more code, more consistency, and a lot more learning! ðŸš€
