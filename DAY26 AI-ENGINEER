🚀 Day 26 of 112 – AI Engineering Journey
Today officially marks the beginning of my Data Analysis journey in Python! 🧠📊

🔍 What I covered today:

✅ Completed key foundational concepts in NumPy:

Intro to NumPy

Getting Started

Creating Arrays

Array Indexing

Array Slicing

Data Types

Copy vs View

Array Shape

Array Reshape

🧪 Practiced real-world array operations and internalized the importance of NumPy for efficient numerical computing in data-heavy projects.

📘 Next Step: I’ll now be diving into the legendary book "Python for Data Analysis" by Wes McKinney — an OG and absolute goldmine for anyone serious about Data Science. This book has shaped many data analysts, and I’m excited to learn from the best. 🙌

⚔️ Also squeezed in some Codewars problems to keep sharpening my logic and Python muscle 💪

🎯 Starting from today, I’m shifting into Data Analysis mode — combining theory with hands-on practice every day moving forward.

If you're also learning Data Science or AI, feel free to connect. Let's build, share, and grow together. 💡
