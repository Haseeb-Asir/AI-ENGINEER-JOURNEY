Day 192 of my AI Engineer Journey !

Today's implementation:
I completed imbalanced data techniques and immediately jumped into Agentic AI - built my first multi-agent system with 3 specialized agents working together.

The process:
Finished SMOTE, ensemble techniques for imbalanced data
Implemented custom cost functions to penalize minority class errors

Started Kaggle + Google's 5-day Agentic AI course
Built multi-agent system: Researcher + Writer + Feedback agents

What I learned:
Custom cost function approach: Instead of resampling data, penalize model differently:

False Negative (missed fraud): Cost = $1000
False Positive (false alarm): Cost = $10
Model optimizes for business impact, not just accuracy
Cost-Sensitive Learning formula: Total Cost = FN_count × FN_cost + FP_count × FP_cost

Result: Model learns minority class is 100x more important!

Agentic AI breakthrough: Built my first multi-agent system where 3 AI agents collaborate:

Agent 1 - Researcher:
Searches and gathers information
Validates sources
Compiles research notes

Agent 2 - Writer:
Takes research notes
Generates structured content
Follows specific writing style

Agent 3 - Feedback:
Reviews writer's output
Provides improvement suggestions
Sends back for revision if needed

How they work together: Researcher → Writer → Feedback → Writer (iterate) → Final output

Key insight: Multiple specialized agents outperform single generalist agent, each with specific role communicating results through shared workspace

The future is agentic: Not single AI doing everything, but AI teams where each agent specializes.

Tomorrow: Day 2 of Agentic AI - building agents that can use tools and make decisions.

From supervised learning to autonomous agents.
192 days later, AI just got real.

Question: Do you think the future of AI is one super-intelligent model or multiple specialized agents working together?
