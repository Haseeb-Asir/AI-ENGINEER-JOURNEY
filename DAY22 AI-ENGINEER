ðŸš€ Day 22/112 â€“ Python GUI + Codewars + GitHub Progress

Today was packed with exciting milestones on my AI Engineering journey:

âœ… Explored GUI development in Python using tkinter
I built my first basic GUI apps â€” with buttons, labels, and input fields. Watching Python turn into interactive windows was a whole new experience! GUI programming adds a creative touch to problem-solving and opens doors for tool-building.

ðŸ§  Solved multiple problems on Codewars
Challenged myself with logic puzzles and real-world-style problems â€” covering topics like:

List slicing & reversing

Edge case handling

Algorithmic thinking

Every single day builds momentum. Staying consistent, learning in public, and sharing the process is what keeps me going.
AI, Iâ€™m coming for you! ðŸš€
