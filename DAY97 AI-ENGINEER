🎯 I just built my first end-to-end ML project — and used my own CGPA, IQ & placement status as the dataset! 😅
I didn’t wait to master all algorithms.
I just started.

Day 97 of #100DaysOfAI
✅ Created a personal dataset
✅ Framed the problem
✅ Preprocessed & engineered features
✅ Ran exploratory data analysis
✅ Trained a Linear Regression model
✅ Evaluated results & made predictions
✅ Documented everything like a blueprint

The goal?
Predict placement status based on student metrics.

The model?
Just Linear Regression (I haven’t mastered algorithms yet — but I used one to learn by doing.)

🧠 What I learned:

ML hits different when it’s your own data

You don't need to know everything to start building

The ML life cycle makes way more sense after this one project

—

💡 This gave me a framework I can reuse.
Not theory — experience.

Next? Explore classification, decision trees, and maybe even real-world datasets 👀

👉 Built something scrappy to learn ML?
Drop “Project” below and I’ll send a screenshot of my process!
