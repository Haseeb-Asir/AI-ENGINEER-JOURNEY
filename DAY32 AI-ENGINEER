DAY 32 Update:

Today was a productive and fun day of hands-on learning! ðŸš€

I spent time practicing on both the Titanic dataset and the Tips dataset, and I can't believe how much I learned! Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what I worked on:

Titanic Dataset:

Data Exploration: I analyzed features like passenger class, age, and fare to uncover patterns in survival rates.

Data Cleaning: Worked through missing values and cleaned up categorical data (e.g., gender and embarkation point). It's amazing how cleaning can set the foundation for meaningful analysis! ðŸ§¹

Feature Engineering: Created new features, like extracting titles from names, and categorized passengers into groups based on their titles. ðŸ“Š

Tips Dataset:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I explored the relationship between total bill and tip amount, and visualized how the time of day or day of the week impacted tips. It was so cool to see the trends that emerged just by looking at the data! ðŸ“…ðŸ’µ

Data Cleaning: Similar to Titanic, I handled missing values and formatted the data properly for analysis. The process was smooth with the right techniques!

Both datasets challenged me to apply different techniques, from data wrangling to feature engineering and visualization. Whatâ€™s even more rewarding is how Iâ€™m starting to connect concepts across different datasets and refine my data analysis skills.

ðŸ’¡ Learning Tip: The more you practice with varied datasets, the better your intuition for spotting patterns and trends becomes. Every dataset is a new puzzle to solve!

Iâ€™m excited to keep applying these skills and build on the foundation Iâ€™ve laid so far. Canâ€™t wait to dive into more complex projects!
