✅ GitHub Day 37: Data Types, Outliers & Feature Scaling
📁 Day 37 - EDA Essentials: Data Types, Invalid Data, Outliers & Scaling

What I Learned Today:

🔍 Outliers: Extreme values that distort insights

Detected using:

📦 Boxplot

📊 Histogram

📈 Z-Score (3-Sigma Rule)

📐 IQR (Interquartile Range)

⚠️ Don't remove outliers blindly! (e.g., time series, daily temperatures)

📌 3-Sigma Rule:

Outlier = Data point > 3 std deviations from mean (Only for normal distributions)

⚙️ Invalid Data Handling:

Correct Unicode

Fix data types (e.g., int, float)

Check invalid ranges (e.g., temp < -273°C ❌)

Format mismatches (e.g., phone numbers with letters)

📊 Types of Data in EDA:

Qualitative (Categorical):

Nominal (e.g., gender)

Ordinal (e.g., economic class)

Quantitative (Numerical):

Discrete (e.g., student count = 30)

Continuous (e.g., temperature = 36.6°C)

📈 Feature Scaling:

🔁 Normalize data to bring everything to the same scale

Techniques:

Min-Max Scaling

Standardization (Z-Score)

Robust Scaler (IQR-based, handles outliers)

🧠 Tomorrow: I’ll continue with feature engineering and EDA project phase!
