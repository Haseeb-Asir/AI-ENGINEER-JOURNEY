🎯 Day 67 — The Power of Asking, “Is It Really Better?”

Today I learned one of the most practical and powerful ideas in data science and decision-making:
→ Hypothesis Testing

Here’s how I simplified it in my head:
I posted some YouTube videos without using a whiteboard. Later, I noticed creators using a whiteboard had longer average views.
So I tried their style. My average view time jumped from 5 min to 13 min on one video.
Success? Not quite.

➡️ That's where hypothesis testing comes in — we don’t rely on one result, we collect data, check assumptions, and use statistics to see if the difference is statistically significant, not just random.

🧪 Two Key Hypotheses:
Null Hypothesis (H₀): New method = Old method (no real change)

Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): New method ≠ Old method (there is a change)

In testing, we never prove anything — we either reject the null or fail to reject it.
Just like a court trial: we assume innocence (null) until there's enough evidence to convict (alternative).

📌 Methods I Learned:
Rejection Region Approach

P-value Approach (more intuitive, compares actual result with the threshold)

It’s not just about data — it’s about asking the right questions and backing decisions with evidence, not assumption.
