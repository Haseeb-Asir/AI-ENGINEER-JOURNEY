Day 12: Mastered Python OOPs Concepts, Completed Mini Projects (Banking Program, Hangman Game)

- Learned and implemented key Python OOP concepts:
  - Class Methods & Static Methods
  - @property Decorators (Getters and Setters)
  - Dunder (Magic) Methods
  - Inheritance (Simple, Multi-level, Multiple)
  - Abstraction and Encapsulation
  - Polymorphism through Inheritance and Duck Typing

- Solved 2-3 Codewars problems focused on OOP and Python challenges.

- Developed two mini projects:
  1. Banking Program: A basic banking system for managing accounts and transactions.
  2. Hangman Game: A fun and interactive hangman game built with OOP.

Great progress today! The knowledge gained will surely be applied to more complex projects in the future.
