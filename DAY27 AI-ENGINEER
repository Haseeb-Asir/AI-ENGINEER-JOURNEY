🚀 Day 27: Getting Deeper with NumPy!

Today was a full-on data crunching day 📊 — I continued my NumPy journey and explored some of its most powerful operations for data analysis and transformation.

🔍 Topics Covered:

✅ reshape() – Changing the shape of arrays like a pro
✅ ndim – Checking how many dimensions our data has
✅ nditer() – Iterating through elements of any shape array
✅ ndenumerate() – Iterating with index info (super helpful!)
✅ arange() – Like Python’s range() but for NumPy arrays
✅ random.permutation() – Shuffle an array easily
✅ random.randint() – Generate random integers
✅ copy() vs view() – Learned the difference with clarity
✅ Assigning data types like: np.array([1,2,3], dtype="i") (int)
✅ concatenate() – Joining arrays (default axis = 0)
✅ array_split() – Smart way to split arrays into parts
✅ where() – Searching arrays based on condition
✅ searchsorted() – Binary search within NumPy arrays

🧠 Every line of code made me more confident in manipulating and preparing data — the backbone of any data analysis or machine learning project.

🧩 These concepts are essential for building pipelines that clean, process, and transform real-world datasets — and today was all about strengthening that foundation.

🧪 Also solved a Codewars problem: "Binary Coded Decimal" — great exercise to blend logical thinking with binary formatting.

On to tomorrow! More data wrangling awaits! 💪
