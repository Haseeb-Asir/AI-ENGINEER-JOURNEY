🚀 Day 45 of my AI Engineering Journey
🔍 Focus: Solving Systems of Linear Equations & Matrix Rank

Today was all about mastering how to solve linear systems using both algebraic and matrix-based approaches. Here's what I covered:

✅ Elimination method for solving equations
✅ Non-singular vs singular systems
✅ Systems with 3 variables (graphical + algebraic)
✅ Matrix row reduction: Row Echelon Form (REF) & Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF)
✅ Rank of a matrix and what it tells us about system solutions
✅ Implemented the Gaussian Elimination Algorithm in code 💻
✅ Completed both ungraded and graded quizzes + programming assignments

🎯 Key takeaway: Understanding matrix rank helps determine if a system has a unique, infinite, or no solution.

Every step brings me closer to mastering the math foundations needed for AI & ML.
Next up: diving deeper into real-world applications of these techniques!
