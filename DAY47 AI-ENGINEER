🚀 Day 47: Diving Deep into Vectors, Matrices & Training My First Neural Network!

Today’s learning journey was all about connecting theory with practice — and I’m super excited to share what I accomplished! 🎉

What I learned today:
🔹 Vectors & Their Properties — scalar multiplication, sums, dot products
🔹 Matrices & Linear Transformations — how matrices transform data and their role in ML
🔹 Matrix Multiplication & Identity/Inverses — key operations that help manipulate data in models

The practical highlight:
💻 Implementing and training a single neuron model for linear regression!

I built a simple perceptron neural network from scratch — feeding input data, calculating predictions, measuring error with a cost function, and updating parameters iteratively. Watching the model improve step-by-step through training was incredibly satisfying! ✨

Why it matters:
This hands-on experience gave me a much clearer understanding of how neural networks really work “under the hood” — bridging the gap between abstract math and real-world AI applications. It feels great to see the math come alive through code! 🧠⚙️

What’s next?
Ready to level up and build more complex neural networks. This journey is challenging but every step is super rewarding! 💪
