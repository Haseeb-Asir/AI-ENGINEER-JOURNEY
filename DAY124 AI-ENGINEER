🔥 Unpopular Opinion: Most people learn multiple linear regression completely backwards.

Day 124: I finally understood why 90% of ML beginners struggle with multiple linear regression - we're taught the math before understanding the dimensional reality.

Here's What Nobody Tells You:
Everyone starts with: "It's just simple linear regression with more columns!"
WRONG. That's like saying "3D movies are just 2D movies with more pixels."

💡 The Mind-Bending Reality:
2D: Draw a line through points → Y = mx + b
3D: Draw a plane through space → Y = β₀ + β₁X₁ + β₂X₂
4D+: Draw a hyperplane through dimensions you can't even visualize → W^T X + W₀ = 0

🎯 My "Aha!" Moment:
Applied this on CGPA + IQ → LPA prediction:

LPA = β₀ + β₁(CGPA) + β₂(IQ)
Suddenly realized I'm not finding a line anymore...
I'm finding a mathematical sheet floating in 3D space!

🔥 The Part That Broke My Brain:
When you add a 4th feature (say, coding score), you're working in 4D space. Your "best fit plane" becomes a hyperplane that exists in dimensions human brains can't visualize.

Yet we're still finding the same thing: The mathematical surface closest to all our data points.

📊 Real Implementation:
Dataset: CGPA, IQ → Salary prediction
Challenge: Visualizing how 2 inputs create 1 output surface
Next: Coding the mathematical derivation from scratch

🤯 The Career Reality:
In production, you're working with 50+ features. That's a hyperplane in 50-dimensional space. No human can visualize this, yet the math still works perfectly.
💭 The Deep Question:
Are we doing machine learning... or just advanced geometry we can't see?

🎯 Controversial Take:

Which approach teaches ML better?
👉 Start with 2D/3D visualization then scale up?
👉 Jump straight to n-dimensional math and skip the visuals?
🔥 Hot Debate: Comment your approach - I'm genuinely curious which method works better for understanding!

💡 Tomorrow's Challenge: I'm implementing the mathematical derivation from scratch. Predict: Will the closed-form solution work the same way as simple linear regression?
Drop a 🧠 if multiple dimensions ever melted your brain!
