Day 164 of my AI Engineer Journey
Today's implementation:
I completed AdaBoost hyperparameter tuning, discovered the key differences between bagging and boosting, then jumped into K-Means clustering.
The process:

Finalized AdaBoost implementation with optimal parameters
Compared bagging vs boosting principles
Coded K-Means from scratch with elbow method
Learned hash map fundamentals for DSA

Bagging vs Boosting - The Core Differences:

Model choice:

Bagging: Low bias, high variance models (full decision trees)
Boosting: High bias, low variance models (decision stumps)


Learning approach:

Bagging: Parallel training, independent models
Boosting: Sequential learning, each model learns from previous mistakes


Model weights:

Bagging: Equal weight for all models
Boosting: Different weights based on performance



K-Means Clustering breakthrough:
5-step algorithm:

Decide K clusters using elbow method (WCSS analysis)
Initialize random centroids
Assign each point to nearest centroid (Euclidean distance)
Move centroids to mean of assigned points
Repeat steps 3-4 until centroids stop moving

Elbow Method:

WCSS (Within-Cluster Sum of Squares) is the sum of squared distances between each point and its centroid
Plot WCSS vs K values, look for the "elbow" point where adding more clusters yields diminishing returns

Key insight:
Boosting focuses on sequential improvement, bagging focuses on parallel diversity. Both reduce variance, different philosophies.
Tomorrow: Deep dive into hash maps and collision handling techniques.
Sequential vs parallel learning.
Both work, different problems.
Question: Do you prefer learning from multiple independent sources simultaneously or following one expert's sequential curriculum?
