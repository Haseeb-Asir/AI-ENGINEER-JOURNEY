 Day 10 of My AI Journey - GitHub Progress üß†

Today, I made significant strides with Python and AI as I continue my learning journey. Here‚Äôs what I accomplished:

‚úÖ Built an advanced Rock Paper Scissors game with sound effects and multi-mode gameplay
‚úÖ Learned about Iterables, Modules, Packages, and the key if __name__ == "__main__"
‚úÖ Tackled a set of Codewars challenges (7 & 8 kyu):
‚Ä¢ Descending Order
‚Ä¢ Square Every Digit
‚Ä¢ Exes and Ohs
‚Ä¢ Shortest Word
‚Ä¢ Opposite Number
‚Ä¢ Grasshopper - Summation
‚Ä¢ Unique In Order

Python Basics & Problem-Solving
Explain the difference between a list and a tuple in Python.

How does the if __name__ == "__main__" construct work in Python?

What are list comprehensions? Can you give an example?

What is the difference between shallow copy and deep copy in Python?

What are Python decorators, and how do they work?

Explain the concept of mutable vs. immutable objects in Python.

How would you handle exceptions in Python? Can you explain the try, except, and finally blocks?

What is the purpose of the self keyword in Python classes?

Algorithms & Data Structures (Python-related)
How would you reverse a list in Python without using built-in functions?

What are some Python libraries you would use for data manipulation and analysis?

Can you explain the time complexity of common operations (e.g., append, insert, remove) in Python lists?

What is a generator in Python? How does it differ from a list?

Explain the difference between a stack and a queue. How would you implement them in Python?

What is a linked list, and how do you implement it in Python?
And here‚Äôs my GitHub repo tracking my progress and projects:
