🤒 Day 118 of my AI Engineer Journey

Confession time: Today was rough.
I dove into the math behind PCA… and honestly, my head’s exploding. 🧠💥

I learned the basics:

PCA calculates a new unit vector axis.

Then it projects data points onto this axis to capture the max variance.

But beyond that? I couldn’t fully grasp it today.
Maybe it’s the flu (yes, caught one 🥲), maybe it’s just PCA being PCA — but it’s still bugging me.

🎯 Lesson (for now):
It’s okay to not “get it” the first time. Some concepts need revisiting with a fresh mind.
Tomorrow, I’ll revise and hopefully crack it.

If you’re like me and prefer visuals → here’s a great resource to see PCA in action:

Question for you:
What’s that one ML/AI concept that took you multiple tries to understand?
