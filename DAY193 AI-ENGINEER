Day 193 of my AI Engineer Journey
Today's implementation:
I built my first recommendation system - a movie recommender using content-based filtering. No ML models, just pure NLP and similarity mathematics.
The process:

Built content-based movie recommender from scratch
Applied text vectorization (TF-IDF) on movie descriptions
Used stemming to normalize words (running → run)
Calculated cosine similarity between movies
Recommended top 5 similar movies based on user input

What I learned:
Content-based vs Collaborative filtering:

Content-based: Recommends based on item features (what I built)
Collaborative: Recommends based on user behavior (needs ML models)
Hybrid: Combines both (tomorrow's goal)

My recommendation pipeline:

Data preprocessing:

Movie dataset: title, genre, cast, director, description
Combined all features into single text string


Stemming:

"loving, loved, loves" → all become "love"
Reduces vocabulary size, increases matching


TF-IDF Vectorization:

Converts text to numerical vectors
Captures word importance across all movies


Cosine similarity:

Measures angle between movie vectors
Range: 0 (completely different) to 1 (identical)



Example recommendation:
Input: "The Dark Knight"
Top 5 similar movies based on genre, cast, and plot keywords
Why no ML models?
Content-based filtering doesn't need training - it's pure similarity computation using vectorization and distance metrics.
The limitation:
Content-based only knows what you've liked. Can't discover new genres or recommend based on what similar users enjoyed.
Tomorrow: Building collaborative filtering recommendation system using ML models to predict user preferences.
Sometimes the simplest solution works.
No need for complexity when similarity suffices.
Question: Do you prefer recommendations based on item similarity (content) or based on what people like you enjoyed (collaborative)?
