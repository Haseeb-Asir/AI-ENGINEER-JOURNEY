Day 128 of my AI Engineer Journey

Gradient descent tutorials are broken.

Complex. Intimidating. Mathematical.

But ultimately... they skip the part that actually matters.

Open any ML course and you'll see:

→ "First, understand the partial derivatives." → "Here's the mathematical proof of convergence." → "Let's derive the optimization theory."

But anyone who's actually implemented it knows this isn't the starting point.

What gradient descent really is?

The simplest idea in ML:

Take any differentiable function → finds the lowest point

Smart guessing with direction instead of random guessing

Non-closed form solution when direct math is too expensive

The backbone of deep learning (every neural network uses this)

Simple logic: adjust your guess based on how wrong you are

Today's implementation:

I coded gradient descent for linear regression with 4 students (CGPA → LPA).

The process:

Start with random B = 10

Calculate slope of loss function

Update: B_new = B_old - learning_rate * slope

Repeat until convergence

What I learned:

Learning rate = 0.1 → bounces around like crazy

Learning rate = 0.01 → smooth convergence

Learning rate = 0.001 → takes forever

The reality?

Gradient descent isn't about calculus mastery. It's about finding the right learning rate and knowing when to stop.

University finals continue (till Sept 9) - squeezing in mini AI sessions between study breaks.

Master the intuition first.

Worry about the math later.

Question: When you first learned gradient descent, what clicked for you - the concept or the implementation?
