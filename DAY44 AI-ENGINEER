🔹 Day 44 of My AI Journey 🔹
🎉 EDA ✅ COMPLETED! 🎉
After weeks of diving deep into data, cleaning it, transforming it, visualizing trends, and crafting powerful features, I’m excited to share that I’ve officially completed the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase of my journey. From feature engineering to understanding data distributions and patterns — it’s been intense, practical, and extremely rewarding.
But now... it’s time to level up.
🚀 Next Stop: The Mathematical Backbone of AI & Machine Learning
As I step into the more abstract yet fundamental side of AI — I’m thrilled to begin learning the mathematics that powers every intelligent system around us.
I'll be following the “Linear Algebra for Machine Learning and Data Science” specialization by DeepLearning.AI on Coursera. This course is part of a broader journey through the core mathematical concepts necessary for building and understanding real ML models.
🔍 Topics I Completed Today:
🧠 Systems of Equations – the core idea of how we can represent and solve problems using linear systems.
📽️ Watched:
Linear Algebra Applied I (6 min)
Linear Algebra Applied II (6 min)
System of Sentences (5 min)
System of Equations (12 min)
System of Equations as Lines and Planes (12 min)
📖 Reading:
Check Your Knowledge (10 min)
I really loved how the course connects linear equations to geometric interpretations (lines, planes, intersections). These are not just formulas — they are the foundation of transformations, model tuning, dimensionality reduction, and more!
⚡ Why this matters to me:
Understanding math deeply is key to becoming a powerful AI engineer — not just someone who uses tools, but someone who understands how and why they work. That’s the level I’m aiming for.
Stay tuned — next I’ll be diving into matrix operations and their real-world applications in ML. Can’t wait! 🔥
