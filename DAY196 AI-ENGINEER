Day 196 of my AI Engineer Journey
Today's implementation:
Feeling under the weather, but couldn't resist starting something cool - WhatsApp Chat Analyzer that reveals hidden patterns in conversations.
The process:

Started building analyzer for both individual and group chats
Learned WhatsApp export format parsing
Planning features: message frequency, word clouds, emoji analysis, most active members
Light work day due to health, but foundation laid

What I'm building:
For individual chats:

Total messages exchanged
Response time patterns
Most used words and emojis
Conversation timeline visualization
Busiest hours/days

For group chats:

Most active members ranking
Message distribution pie chart
Group emoji leaderboard
Who starts conversations most
Peak activity times

Why this project excites me:
WhatsApp exports = messy unstructured text data
Challenge = parsing timestamps, handling different formats, extracting insights
Technical approach:

Regex for parsing timestamps and message structure
Pandas for data manipulation and time series analysis
Matplotlib/Plotly for visualizations
Streamlit for interactive dashboard

Tomorrow: Full implementation with live demo results from my actual group chats. The insights might be surprising!
Sometimes best projects come from curiosity.
Not curriculum.
Question: What's one dataset from your daily life you'd love to analyze?
