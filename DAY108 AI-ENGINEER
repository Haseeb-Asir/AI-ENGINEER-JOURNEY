🚀 Day 108 of my AI Engineer Journey

Today felt like two wins in one…

1️⃣ Built my first end-to-end ML Pipeline:

Input → impute missing values in Age & Fare
Encode Embarked column
Feature scaling
Feature engineering
Final model output

No more messy, scattered preprocessing code , everything flows step-by-step.

2️⃣ Played with Transformations (on Titanic dataset 🛳)

Applied log, sqrt, square, and reciprocal transforms to Age & Fare.
Validated accuracy for Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree.

Lesson learned:
1.Pipelines = cleaner, reproducible workflows
2.Transformations can seriously shift model performance (especially for algorithms sensitive to feature scale & distribution).

Do you always include transformations in your ML pipelines?
