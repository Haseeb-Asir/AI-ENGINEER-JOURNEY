Day 150 of my AI Engineer Journey
Today's implementation:
I built my first Decision Tree from scratch and finally understood why they're called "white box" algorithms.
The process:

Calculated entropy and information gain for each feature split
Implemented recursive tree building with stopping criteria
Compared Gini impurity vs entropy for split selection
Built complete CART algorithm for classification

What I learned:

Entropy: Measures disorder in data (0 = pure, 1 = maximum chaos)
Information gain: How much uncertainty a split removes
Gini impurity: Faster to compute than entropy, max value 0.5
Root → Decision nodes → Leaf nodes create interpretable rules

Decision Tree algorithm steps:

Calculate entropy/Gini for current dataset
Test all possible feature splits
Choose split with highest information gain
Recursively repeat until stopping criteria met

DSA breakthrough:
Mastered linked list reversal 
Foundation for many advanced list operations

Key insight:
Decision trees naturally handle non-linear relationships without feature engineering, unlike logistic regression.
The interpretability advantage:
Can literally trace the decision path: "If age > 30 AND income > 50k, then approve loan."
Tomorrow: Handling overfitting with pruning techniques and tackling more advanced linked list problems.
Simple algorithms can solve complex problems.
When you can explain the logic clearly.
Question: Do you prefer "black box" algorithms with high accuracy or "white box" algorithms you can fully explain?
