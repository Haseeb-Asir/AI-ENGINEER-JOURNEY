📘 Day 65 of AI

Today I focused on one of the most powerful tools in inferential statistics:

 → Point Estimates and the start of Confidence Intervals.

A point estimate gives us a best-guess number (like a sample mean) to represent an entire population. But real-world data isn’t perfect — and that’s where confidence intervals come in, helping us define a range we’re statistically confident the true value lies within.

I’ve covered everything from the definition up to confidence level — tomorrow I’ll dive into the factors that affect margin of error.

🎯 I also revised part of the Titanic dataset case study to solidify my understanding with real data.

⚠️ Since midterm exams are starting from coming saturday, I’m keeping the pace lighter.

 ⏳ I’ll be back to full flow by June 27, inshaAllah.

Even small learning counts — it all adds up.
