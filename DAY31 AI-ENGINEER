🎯 #TDAU Day 31 — Mastering Data Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn!

Today, I focused on one of the most crucial skills in data science and AI: visualizing data to discover insights and communicate results effectively.

🔍 What I Learned:

📌 Matplotlib Basics

Created basic plots: line, scatter, and histograms

Customized axes, titles, legends, and colors

Learned how to combine multiple plots using subplots()

📌 Seaborn Essentials

Loaded built-in datasets like tips for quick practice

Visualized distributions using histplot, kdeplot, and boxplot

Compared categories with barplot, countplot, and violinplot

Explored relationships using pairplot and correlation heatmaps

💻 Hands-On Practice:
Used the tips dataset to answer fun real-world questions:

Do people tip more on weekends?

Is there a difference in tipping behavior between men and women?

How does the size of the dining group impact the total bill?

Visualized everything using Seaborn's intuitive API and loved how quick and beautiful the results are!

📊 Why This Matters:
Data visualization isn't just about pretty graphs — it’s about telling a story with your data. It's often the bridge between raw numbers and actionable insights, especially in AI and ML projects.

🛠️ Tools Used:
Python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

📈 Sample Plot:
(Optional: attach an image of your heatmap, pairplot, or bar chart)

🔥 Excited to move forward and soon begin my machine learning journey!
