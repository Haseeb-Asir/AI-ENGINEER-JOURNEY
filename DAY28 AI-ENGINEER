🚀 Day 28: Wrapping Up NumPy & Stepping into Pandas!

Today marked the completion of my NumPy journey and the exciting start of pandas — the powerhouse for real-world data analysis 📊.

🔢 Final NumPy Concepts Covered:
✅ Broadcasting – Add scalars directly to arrays with ease:
    a = a + 5 ➝ adds 5 to every element — no loops needed!

✅ np.hstack() / np.vstack() – Horizontally & vertically stack arrays effortlessly.

✅ np.sort() – Sorted arrays like a breeze, element-wise across any axis.

✅ Universal Functions (ufuncs) – These NumPy functions (like np.exp(), np.sqrt(), etc.) are lightning fast due to internal C-level optimization — super sonic speed!

🐼 Entering the World of Pandas:
✅ Learned the basics of pandas Series — 1D labeled arrays that make data handling intuitive and powerful.

💡 Tomorrow, I dive into DataFrames — the heart of pandas and real data manipulation.
