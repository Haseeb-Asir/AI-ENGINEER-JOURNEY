COMPLETE SUMMARY OF WHOLE EDA ..
Today I took a moment to reflect… and wow — I’ve completed the full cycle of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)! 🔍📊
Here’s a quick breakdown of all I’ve learned so far:
🔹 Feature Scaling
🧂 Scaling = Bringing all numbers into a similar range so no feature dominates the model.
 Two major techniques:
Normalization (Min-Max Scaling) → Scale to [0,1]
Standardization (Z-score Scaling) → Scale based on mean and standard deviation
🎯 Why Scaling Matters
Example:
Age: 18, 25, 30
Salary: 10,000, 50,000, 90,000
 Without scaling, the model gets biased toward larger numbers like salary, even if age is more important.
🔍 Outlier Detection
Outliers = Extreme values that can affect model accuracy
 Detected using:
Box Plot 📦
Histogram 📊
Z-score (±3σ)
Interquartile Range (IQR)
🛑 Outliers aren't always bad!
 In time series (e.g., temperature), keep them — they could be real anomalies.
🧪 3-Sigma Rule
Used to detect and remove outliers using standard deviation (σ)
🧯 Handling Invalid Data
Ensure correct data types
Encode Unicode properly
Check realistic value ranges
Validate structural consistency (e.g., phone numbers)
📂 Types of Data
➤ Categorical (Qualitative)
Nominal: No order (e.g., Gender)
Ordinal: Has order (e.g., Economic class)
➤ Numerical (Quantitative)
Discrete: Countable (e.g., students in class)
Continuous: Measurable (e.g., weight, height)
📊 Types of Analysis
Univariate → One variable (e.g., pie chart for gender)
Bivariate → Two variables (e.g., age vs. income)
Multivariate → More than two variables
🧮 Derived Metrics
Created new features from existing ones for better insight.
 E.g., From DOB → Age, or combine two features for ratios.
🧱 Feature Binning (Converting Numerical → Categorical)
Grouped continuous numbers into bins like 0–10, 10–20, etc.
🔹 Unsupervised Binning
Equal Width
Equal Frequency
🔸 Supervised Binning
Entropy-based (uses target variable to make smarter splits)
🏷️ Feature Encoding (Converting Categorical → Numerical)
Label Encoding → Male = 0, Female = 1
❌ Can mislead models due to order
One-Hot Encoding → Adds new binary columns
✅ Most preferred
Dummy Encoding → One-hot but drops one column to avoid redundancy
Target Encoding → Replace category with target mean
Hash Encoding → Great for high-cardinality features
🔥 What’s Next?
I now have a solid grip on the entire EDA cycle — from raw data to clean, structured, and model-ready datasets.
✅ It's time to jump into hands-on practice with real-world projects, machine learning models, and sharpen my skills further!
Let’s keep building! 💪
