✅ Day 88 – Statistics for AI (Revision)
Chi-Square Tests + ANOVA – Now with practical examples & Python

🔍 Today’s Focus was on revising two powerful tools used in hypothesis testing for categorical & multi-group comparison:

📊 CHI-SQUARE TESTS
1️⃣ Goodness-of-Fit Test – Does observed distribution match expected?
2️⃣ Test of Independence – Are two categorical variables related?

✅ Use cases:

Feature selection (cat vs target)

EDA between categories

Evaluating Confusion Matrices

CHIAD tree splits

🧪 ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)
📌 Used when comparing means of more than 2 groups

1️⃣ One-Way ANOVA – One independent variable
2️⃣ Two-Way ANOVA – Two independent variables (factors)

✅ Use cases:

Multi-group A/B/C testing

Comparing strategies in business experiments

Feature impact on model output (SHAP, performance)

🧠 Not just theory – implemented examples in Python to grasp calculations & real applications.

📅 Tomorrow: More statistical testing + confidence intervals in Python.
