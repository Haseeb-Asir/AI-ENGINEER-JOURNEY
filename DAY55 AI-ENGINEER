ðŸ§  Day 55 of my AI Engineer Journey â€“ MATHS

Today was all about deep diving into some core probability concepts that keep popping up in AI and stats:

ðŸŽ¯ Topics I covered:

Random Variables (Discrete vs Continuous)

Probability Distributions

Probability Mass Function (PMF)

Probability Density Function (PDF)

Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)

Why we use density instead of exact probability in continuous data

How the area under the PDF curve gives us the actual probability

Famous probability distributions (normal, uniform, poisson, etc.)

Parameters that define a distribution's shape and spread

Itâ€™s finally clicking how all these connect and build up to real-world data modeling. ðŸ’¡
