Day 141 of my AI Engineer Journey
Today's implementation:
I coded Lasso Regression and discovered it's like Ridge's ruthless cousin.
The process:

Changed penalty from λM² (Ridge) to λ|M| (Lasso)
Tested different λ values on 10-feature dataset
Watched coefficients disappear completely
Compared feature selection vs Ridge shrinkage

What I learned:

λ = 0 → All 10 features kept (overfitting)
λ = 0.1 → 3 coefficients became exactly zero
λ = 1.0 → Only 2 important features survived
λ = 10 → All coefficients zero (underfitting)

Key difference:
Ridge shrinks coefficients toward zero. Lasso kills them completely.
The feature selection magic:

Started with 10 features
Lasso automatically identified 2 most important ones
Removed 8 irrelevant features without manual selection
Model became simpler and more interpretable

When to use Lasso:
High-dimensional data where you suspect many features are useless.
Implementation reality: Absolute value makes it non-differentiable at zero - requires special optimization techniques.
Tomorrow: Elastic Net - combining Ridge and Lasso for best of both worlds.
Sometimes the best solution is elimination.
Not shrinkage, but complete removal.
Question: When building models, do you prefer automatic feature selection or manual feature engineering?
