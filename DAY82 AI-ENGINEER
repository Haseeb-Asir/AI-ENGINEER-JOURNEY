📘 Day 82 -- From Math to Code: Linear Algebra in Python

Today I explored how to apply linear algebra concepts using Python — going beyond theory and seeing how math becomes code.

🔹 Matrix operations
🔹 Dot product & cross product
🔹 Vector normalization
🔹 Using NumPy for fast, efficient linear algebra
🔹 Understanding how libraries like scikit-learn and TensorFlow build on this foundation

It’s powerful to see how the math we learn transforms into the code that drives machine learning.

Excited to experiment more and make things move with math 💻➕📐
