Days 133-135 of my AI Engineer Journey
Exams are over. I'm back.
Rusty. Eager. Ready to catch up.
But ultimately... 3 days away made me realize what I'd forgotten about gradient descent.
Most people think gradient descent is just one algorithm:
→ "Use gradient descent to minimize your loss function."
→ "It's the same process for any dataset size."
→ "Just update all parameters together."
But anyone who's worked with real datasets knows there are actually 3 different approaches.
What 3 days of intensive catch-up taught me?
The gradient descent reality check:

Batch Gradient Descent: Uses entire dataset for each update

Perfect math, terrible performance
Computationally heavy, rarely used in real-world


Stochastic Gradient Descent: Updates parameters row-by-row

Fast, noisy, industry standard
Used everywhere in production


Mini-Batch Gradient Descent: Best of both worlds

Updates in chunks (e.g., 30 rows at a time)
Balanced speed + stability



Multiple Linear Regression breakthrough:
Moved from Y = mx + b to Y = β₀ + β₁X₁ + β₂X₂
The complexity jump:

Initialize: β₀=0, β₁=1, β₂=1 (multiple parameters now)
Update rule: β_new = β_old - learning_rate × slope
Slope calculation: Partial derivatives for EACH β parameter
Loss visualization: Now in higher dimensions (can't draw it!)

Formula reality:
∂L/∂β_m = -2/N Σ(Y_i - Ŷ_i)X_im
What exam break taught me:
Taking 3 days off made me appreciate how much I'd learned. Coming back, the concepts felt more solid, not more foreign.
Tomorrow: Testing all 3 gradient descent types on the same dataset to see speed differences.
Sometimes a break makes you realize how far you've come.
Knowledge compounds when you return.
Question: After taking a break from learning, do you come back stronger or do you feel like you've lost momentum?
