🔁 Day 83 – I’m Back! Revision + Practical Dive Begins 🔁
After a short break (due to ISSB), I’m finally back on track with my AI journey! 🚀
To refresh and reinforce my concepts, I began from the very basics of Statistics — starting from definitions and probability — and revised everything with handwritten notes 📝. This time, I'm taking a more practical and code-oriented approach, especially for the Maths for AI part.

✅ Covered till:
Probability Fundamentals
PMF (Probability Mass Function)
CDF (Cumulative Distribution Function)
Code-based implementation in Python (NumPy + matplotlib)
📌 Now shifting focus to applying stats with code, so I can build stronger AI models later.
Let’s keep pushing forward. From here on, it’s all about practicing, building, and sharing.
