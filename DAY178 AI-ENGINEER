Day 178 of my AI Engineer Journey
Today's implementation:
I derived the complete math behind Naive Bayes and discovered why Gaussian distribution is the secret to handling continuous data.
The process:

Applied chain rule for conditional probability
Broke down P(X₁, X₂...Xₙ | Cₖ) into product of P(Xᵢ | Cₖ)
Implemented Gaussian Naive Bayes with mean and standard deviation
Coded hash table delete, get_item, set_item functions using linear probing

What I learned:
The Mathematical Formula:
P(Cₖ | X) = P(Cₖ) × ∏P(Xᵢ | Cₖ)
Each P(Xᵢ | Cₖ) calculated separately, then multiplied.
Gaussian Naive Bayes for continuous data:
When features are continuous (height, weight, age), we can't just count frequencies. Solution: assume normal distribution.
For each feature and class:

Calculate mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ)
Use probability density function to get likelihood of any value

Example:
Feature: Height for "Basketball Player" class

Mean = 6.5 feet, σ = 0.5
Query: Height = 6.8 feet
Calculate: PDF(6.8 | μ=6.5, σ=0.5) = 0.52

Key insight:
Gaussian Naive Bayes uses probability density function determined by mean and variance for each feature, computed from training data to calculate likelihood of data point belonging to particular class
When it fails:
If data isn't normally distributed (e.g., bimodal), Gaussian assumption breaks. Solution: use kernel density estimation or transform data.
DSA progress:
Completed hash table implementation with collision handling - delete, get, and set operations using linear probing.
Tomorrow: XGBoost - the gradient boosting on steroids that wins Kaggle competitions.
Continuous data needs continuous probability.
Discrete counting won't work.
Question: Do you test if your data is normally distributed before using Gaussian models or just try and see?
