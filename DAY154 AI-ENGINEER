Day 154 of my AI Engineer Journey
Today's implementation:
Apartment shifting chaos, but I squeezed in a quick review session of ensemble learning fundamentals.
The process:

Reviewed voting ensemble key concepts while packing boxes
Practiced stack problem solutions between apartment visits
Reinforced the mathematical foundation of ensemble accuracy
Maintained learning momentum despite logistical disruption

What I reviewed:

Independence assumption: Why models must make different errors
50% accuracy threshold: The critical minimum for ensemble benefit
Hard vs soft voting trade-offs in different scenarios
Stack applications: Celebrity problem and duplicate removal patterns

Key reinforcement:
The mathematical beauty of ensemble learning - three 60% accurate independent models create 75% ensemble accuracy through error cancellation.
Shifting reality check:
Moving apartments is teaching me about real-world project management - unexpected delays, resource constraints, and adaptation strategies.
Next week planning:

Days 155-161: Apartment transition period
Continuing with quick review sessions and concept reinforcement
Focus on bagging and Random Forest when settled
DSA queue implementation when back to full schedule

The learning continues:
Even during life transitions, maintaining daily learning habits keeps momentum alive.
Tomorrow: More packing, more quick reviews, and keeping the 200+ day streak going.
Consistency beats perfection.
Small progress during chaos beats no progress.
Question: How do you maintain learning habits during major life disruptions like moving or career changes?
