Day 171 of my AI Engineer Journey
Today's implementation:
I learned hierarchical clustering and finally understood why dendrograms are the most intuitive visualization in unsupervised learning.
The process:

Studied agglomerative vs divisive clustering approaches
Implemented 4 different linkage methods
Created dendrograms to visualize cluster formation
Compared with K-Means performance

Two Approaches:

Agglomerative (Bottom-up): Start with N clusters (each point), merge closest pairs iteratively
Divisive (Top-down): Start with 1 cluster, recursively split into smaller clusters

Four Linkage Methods in Agglomerative:

Single Link (Minimum):

Distance = minimum distance between any two points
Prone to chaining effect from outliers


Complete Link (Maximum):

Distance = maximum distance between any two points
May break large, elongated clusters


Group Average:

Distance = average of all pairwise distances
Balances single and complete link


Ward's Method:

Minimizes within-cluster variance
Most commonly used in practice



Dendrogram Magic:
To find optimal clusters, plot dendrogram and choose longest vertical line not cut by horizontal lines - that's your natural cluster count!
K-Means vs Hierarchical:

Key insight:
Hierarchical clustering doesn't need you to specify number of clusters beforehand - the dendrogram reveals natural groupings in data.
The trade-off:
More flexibility and better visualization, but computationally expensive for large datasets.
Tomorrow: DBSCAN - density-based clustering that handles irregular shapes and noise.
Sometimes the journey matters more than the destination.
Dendrograms show the path, not just the result.
Question: Do you prefer algorithms that require upfront decisions (K-Means) or ones that let data reveal structure (Hierarchical)?
