Day 54: Stats that finally made sense ðŸ§ ðŸ“Š

Today I explored some powerful concepts that honestly, I wish I had learned before diving into EDA & feature engineering.

Hereâ€™s what clicked for me:

Quantiles, Quartiles, Percentiles

5 Number Summary & IQR

Box Plot (finally gets outliers!)

Scatter Plot (hello, relationships!)

Covariance vs. Correlation

And a bit of multivariate viz magic ðŸ”®

Itâ€™s wild how much clearer things get once you understand the why behind the plots we use every day.

If you're just starting out in data, learn these early â€” itâ€™ll save you so much confusion later. ðŸ™Œ
