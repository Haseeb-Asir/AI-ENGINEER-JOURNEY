Day 163 of my AI Engineer Journey
Today's implementation:
I coded AdaBoost from scratch and discovered why it's called "adaptive" - it literally learns from its own mistakes.
The process:

Built ensemble of decision stumps (max_depth=1 weak learners)
Implemented weight update mechanism for misclassified points
Calculated alpha values for each model using error rates
Combined predictions using weighted voting

What I learned:

Initial weights: All rows start with equal weight (1/N)
Alpha calculation: α = 0.5 × ln((1-error)/error)
Weight updates for misclassified: w_new = w_old × e^α
Weight updates for correct: w_new = w_old × e^(-α)

AdaBoost algorithm steps:

Assign equal weights to all training samples (1/N)
Train decision stump on weighted data
Calculate total error and alpha for this stump
Increase weights for misclassified points, decrease for correct ones
Normalize weights to sum to 1
Resample based on new weight distribution
Repeat with next stump focusing on hard examples

Final prediction:
sign(α₁h₁(x) + α₂h₂(x) + ... + αₙhₙ(x))
DSA breakthrough:
Implemented queue using two stacks - classic interview problem showing how one data structure can simulate another.
Key insight:
AdaBoost forces subsequent models to focus on previously misclassified points through upsampling, creating specialists for hard cases.
Tomorrow: Gradient Boosting - the algorithm that evolved from AdaBoost and powers XGBoost.
Sequential learning beats parallel learning.
When mistakes guide the next attempt.
Question: Do you learn more from your successes or your failures?
