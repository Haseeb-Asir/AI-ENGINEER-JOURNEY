💡 Data Alone Isn’t Enough – How You Treat It Matters
DAY104....
Today, I took a deep dive into Feature Transformation the step in Machine Learning that quietly decides whether your model will shine or struggle.

Here’s what clicked for me:
🔹 Standardization
 Formula: (x – mean) / standard deviation
Centers data around 0 with a standard deviation of 1.
Crucial for algorithms like SVM, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks.
*Not always needed (e.g., tree-based models don’t care much).*

🔹 Normalization 
 scaling data into a smaller range
Types I explored:
Min-Max Scaling : squashes data between 0 and 1 (great for bounded inputs).
Mean Normalization : centers around mean in a defined range.
Max Absolute Scaling : keeps direction of data but limits by absolute max.
Robust Scaling : ignores outliers by using median & IQR (a lifesaver for messy data).

💭 What I learned:
Choosing the right transformation is like choosing the right shoes depends on the terrain (algorithm + data type). Wrong fit? You’ll trip. Right fit? You’ll run faster.

Tomorrow → I move into the next part of Feature Engineering.
If you’ve ever seen your model underperform for “no reason,” check your data’s shoes first. 👟
