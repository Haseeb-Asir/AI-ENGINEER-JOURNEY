 Day 75 of AI Engineer:
One of the most foundational concepts in AI and statistics: Probability.
 Understanding how likely an event is to occur helps shape everything from algorithms to real-world decisions.
🎯 5 Key Terms I Revised:
Random Experiment – Has more than one possible outcome, unpredictable in advance
Trial – A single run of the experiment
Outcome – One possible result of a trial
Sample Space – The set of all possible outcomes
Event – A specific result or set of outcomes we care about (like getting heads on a coin toss)
🔍 Types of Events I Learned
Simple (one outcome)
Compound (two or more outcomes)
Independent (no effect on each other)
Dependent (one affects the other)
Mutually Exclusive (can’t happen together)
Exhaustive (at least one must happen)
Impossible (can’t happen, like rolling a 7 on a six-sided die)
📊 Types of Probability:
✅ Empirical Probability
 → Based on real-world data
 → Example: Getting heads 47 out of 100 coin flips → P = 0.47
✅ Theoretical Probability
 → Based on logic when outcomes are equally likely
 → Example: P(rolling a 4 on a fair die) = 1/6 = 0.166
🔁 Key Takeaway:
 Probability isn't just about numbers — it’s about quantifying uncertainty, and that’s exactly what powers decision-making in machine learning.
