🚀 Day 114 of my AI Engineer Journey

Missing data isn’t just an “annoyance”… sometimes it’s the hardest puzzle in ML. 🧩

Today I leveled up from univariate imputation → into multivariate imputation (using all columns to fill missing values, not just the one).

Here’s what I explored 👇

1️⃣ KNN Imputer (K-Nearest Neighbors)

Finds the “nearest rows” (neighbors) using Euclidean distance.

Fills missing values with neighbor(s) → exact value (k=1) or average (k>1).

✅ Super accurate

❌ Slow & memory-heavy (needs training data at inference)

2️⃣ Iterative Imputer (MICE)

Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations.

Predicts missing values of one column using all other columns.

Works iteratively until predictions stabilize.

✅ Very powerful (captures relationships between features)

❌ Computationally expensive

💡 My big takeaway:
Univariate methods are quick band-aids. But real-world datasets need smarter imputation that respects feature relationships. Accuracy often comes at the cost of compute — so there’s always a trade-off.

👉 Question for the pros:
When deploying ML models, do you prefer lightweight imputations (mean/mode) for speed, or heavy ones (KNN, MICE) for accuracy?
