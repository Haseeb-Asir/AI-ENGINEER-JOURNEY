Today I dove into the advanced side of probability — where we stop thinking about outcomes as labels, and start treating them as numerical mappings through functions.
🎯 What is a Random Variable?
A Random Variable is not a variable — it’s a function that maps the outcomes of a random experiment to real numbers.
🧠 Example:
Toss a coin → H = 1, T = 0
Roll two dice → Output = sum (e.g. (3,4) → 7)
📊 What I Explored Today:
✅ Probability Distribution
→ A full list of possible values of the random variable, with probabilities.
(PDF: y = f(x), gives P(X = x))
✅ Expected Value (Mean)
→ Think of it as the long-run average of outcomes
→ Weighted average of all possible outcomes, multiplied by their probabilities
✅ Variance of a Random Variable
→ Measures how much the values deviate from the mean
→ Formula I learned:

Var(𝑋)=𝐸[𝑋2]−(𝐸[𝑋])^2
Var(X)=E[X 2 ]−(E[X])^2
 
🧠 Why it matters:
In data science, ML, and AI — randomness is everywhere.
Understanding how outcomes behave on average and how they spread is how we build robust models and make data-driven decisions.
