📘 Day 64 of My AI Journey
Today’s learning was lighter — but still meaningful. With quizzes and midterms starting tomorrow, I focused on strengthening my fundamentals. 🎯

I dove deeper into the difference between:
🔹 Population vs Sample
🔹 Parameters vs Estimates (Statistics)
🔹 And touched on the basics of Inferential Statistics — the core of prediction and generalization in Data Science.

One powerful reminder:

📊 We rarely get to see the whole population — but with the right sample and tools, we can say a lot about it. That’s the heart of inferential stats.

⚠️ I’ll be going a bit slow until June 27th due to exams — but not stopping. Learning never pauses — it just changes pace. 📉➡️📈

I’ll be back stronger and more consistent after the break, with bigger energy and deeper dives! 💪
