ðŸš€ Day34 of AI ENGINEERING


Today I dedicated a solid chunk of time to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€” a crucial step in any AI/ML project. Before diving into modeling, understanding the data is everything. ðŸ§ ðŸ“Š

I practiced EDA on multiple datasets:
ðŸ”¹ Iris â€“ classic dataset to explore feature distributions and class separability
ðŸ”¹ Online Retail (Excel) â€“ performed time-series revenue analysis, spike detection, and customer behavior
ðŸ”¹ Titanic â€“ explored missing values, survival rates by gender/class, and visualized insights

Key skills sharpened:
âœ… Data cleaning & formatting
âœ… Feature extraction (e.g., date to month/year)
âœ… Plotly + Seaborn for visual insights
âœ… Detecting trends, outliers, and dominant patterns

âš¡ Reminder to self: Great ML starts with great EDA.
No shortcuts. The more you understand the data, the smarter your models become. ðŸ’¯

ðŸ“Œ Tomorrow, Iâ€™ll either continue with more datasets or transition into some feature engineering or modeling.
