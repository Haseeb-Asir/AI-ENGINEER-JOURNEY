📘 Day 77 – Connecting the Dots of Probability

Today I explored how events, data, and probability intersect — quite literally through Venn diagrams, contingency tables, and foundational concepts like joint, marginal, and conditional probability.

🔍 What I Explored:
🟢 Venn Diagrams
Visualized how sample space (universal set) and events like A and B fit within it.
P(A) = values in circle A / total values → makes abstract concepts more intuitive.

🟨 Contingency Tables
Used to display joint frequencies and probabilities between two variables.
Great for analyzing real datasets (like Titanic 🚢: Pclass vs Survived)

📊 Types of Probability:
1️⃣ Joint Probability
→ Probability of two events happening together
→ e.g., P(Survived = Yes AND Pclass = 1)

2️⃣ Marginal Probability
→ Probability of a single event, ignoring others
→ e.g., P(Survived = Yes) no matter the class

3️⃣ Conditional Probability
→ Probability of one event, given another has occurred
→ e.g., P(Survived = Yes | Pclass = 1)
📌 Formula:
𝑃(𝐴∣𝐵)=𝑃(𝐴∩𝐵)𝑃(𝐵)
P(A∣B)= P(B)P(A∩B)
 
🔁 Bayes’ Theorem – Updating Beliefs with Evidence
Discovered how Bayes’ Theorem flips conditional probability to ask:
“Given this outcome, how likely is the cause?”
𝑃(𝐴∣𝐵)=𝑃(𝐴)⋅
𝑃(𝐵∣𝐴)𝑃(𝐵)
P(A∣B)= P(B)P(A)⋅P(B∣A)
​
 
🔍 Used in spam filters, recommendation systems, fraud detection, and medical diagnosis.
Thomas Bayes really handed us the blueprint for rational thinking under uncertainty.

🧠 It’s exciting to finally connect the visual, theoretical, and applied sides of probability. From diagrams to code, it’s all starting to make sense.
