🚀 Day 110 of my AI Engineer Journey

Today I flipped the script , instead of turning categories into numbers,
I turned numbers into categories. 📊➡️📦
Why?

 Sometimes, raw continuous values aren’t the best for a model ,especially if the relationship with the target is non-linear.

Grouping them into bins can help models capture patterns better.
Example:
 Instead of exact ages like 22, 34, 58…
We can group into Young, Middle-aged, Senior.

What I explored today:

1️⃣ Binning / Discretization
Equal Width → Same range size for each bin.
Equal Frequency → Each bin has the same number of samples.
K-Means Binning → Uses clustering to find natural groupings.

2️⃣ Binarization
Converts numerical values into 0 or 1 based on a threshold.

🛠 Hands-on test (Titanic Dataset)
Applied binning to Age, Fare, and Pclass.
Compared model accuracy before vs. after binning across algorithms (following my earlier pipeline + transformation steps).

Lesson learned:
 Binning isn’t just a “simplification” — it can help models detect non-linear patterns and reduce noise,and prone to outliers.
 but it’s not always a guaranteed performance boost. Testing is 🔑
.
Have you seen binning improve your ML models’ accuracy?
