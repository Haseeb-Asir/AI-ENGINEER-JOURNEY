Day 123: The Metric That Fooled Me

🤯 I thought my model was amazing... until I used the RIGHT metric.

Day 123: Built a logistic regression from scratch and discovered 5 evaluation metrics that completely changed how I judge model performance. One metric made me feel like a genius, another humbled me instantly.

😅 My Rookie Mistake:
Started with R² Score and got 0.85 → "Wow, 85% accuracy!"
Then calculated MAE → suddenly realized my predictions were off by ₹50,000 on average 💸

💡 The 5 Metrics That Actually Matter:
1️⃣ MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

What: Average distance between predicted vs actual
Why I love it: Same units as your target (₹, not ₹²)
Reality check: Shows you EXACTLY how wrong you are

2️⃣ MSE (Mean Squared Error)

The math: Σ(yᵢ - ŷᵢ)² / n
Superpower: Differentiable → works with gradient descent
Weakness: Outliers destroy it (thanks to squaring)

3️⃣ RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

Best of both worlds: Interpretable units + optimization-friendly
When to use: When outliers exist but you still need gradients

4️⃣ R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)

Formula: 1 - (SSR/SSM)
Translation: "How much better am I than just guessing the average?"
Plot twist: Can go negative (yes, worse than guessing!)

5️⃣ Adjusted R² Score

Problem it solves: Regular R² lies when you add random features
Reality: Adding "temperature on placement day" shouldn't improve CGPA→Package prediction!

🎯 Real Implementation:
Applied all 5 metrics on the same CGPA→Package dataset:

R² = 0.85 (looked impressive)
MAE = ₹52,000 (ouch, reality hits)
RMSE = ₹67,000 (outliers are killing me)

📚 Deep Dive Resource:

🔥 The Career Lesson:
In interviews, they don't just ask "what's your model's accuracy?" They ask "WHY did you choose THAT metric?" Now I know the answer isn't just about math—it's about business impact.
💭 The Bigger Picture:
Choosing the wrong evaluation metric is like measuring a marathon runner's speed in a 100m sprint. Same athlete, completely different story.

🤔 Hot Take Question:
When evaluating ML models in production, what matters more:
👉 Mathematical elegance (perfect R² scores)?
👉 Business reality (actual rupee/dollar impact)?
