📘 Day 80 Linear Algebra Deep Dive:

Today was all about understanding the machinery behind ML models — the math that transforms, rotates, scales, and makes sense of our data in higher dimensions.

🧠 What I Learned:
🔹 Unit Vectors
The most fundamental building blocks —
𝑖^=[1,0],𝑗^=[0,1]
i^=[1,0], 
j^=[0,1]
All vectors are just scaled combinations of these (basis vectors).
They help define directions in space.

🔹 Linear Transformations
Transform vectors while keeping the grid structure:
✅ No curves
✅ Evenly spaced lines
✅ Origin remains fixed
Used in computer vision & image transformations.

🔹 Vector Operations

Scalar Multiplication → scales vector size

Span → set of all vectors that can be formed from given ones

Linear Dependence → one vector can be formed by others (no new direction)

📊 Geometry Meets Algebra:
✅ Hyperplanes
ML uses them to separate classes:
𝑤𝑇𝑥+𝑤0=0w Tx+w0 =0
✅ Intercepts

X-intercept: where y = 0

Y-intercept: where x = 0

✅ System of Linear Equations
Used to find values that satisfy all equations — solved using Gaussian Elimination, Matrix Inversion, or SVD.

📌 Why it matters:
Whether it’s feature reduction in PCA, stability in optimization, or structure in neural nets — linear algebra is everywhere in ML. Today, I didn’t just memorize — I visualized how everything connects.
