Day 195 of my AI Engineer Journey
Today's implementation:
I built a complete email spam classifier with Streamlit frontend - 5000+ emails trained, 98.3% accuracy achieved, deployment... still in progress.
The process:

Trained Multinomial Naive Bayes on SMS Spam Collection dataset
Built preprocessing pipeline: tokenization → stemming → TF-IDF
Created Streamlit web interface with text input and prediction
Tested on real spam emails (all detected correctly!)

What I learned:
Model performance:

Training accuracy: 98.7%
Test accuracy: 98.3%
Training time: 0.4 seconds
Prediction time: <0.01 seconds

Spam detection results:
Tested 5 real examples:

"Congratulations! You won $1000. Click here to claim" → SPAM ✓
"Meeting rescheduled to 3pm tomorrow" → HAM ✓
"URGENT! Your account will be suspended" → SPAM ✓
"Can you send me the project report?" → HAM ✓
"Free iPhone! Limited offer!!!" → SPAM ✓

Streamlit interface built:

Text area for email input
"Check Spam" button
Result display with confidence score
Clean, minimal UI in 30 lines of Python

The deployment challenge:
Built everything locally, but deployment to Streamlit Cloud hit issues. Learning curve on requirements.txt, dependencies, and cloud configuration.
Key insight:
Building the model: 2 hours
Building the UI: 30 minutes
Trying to deploy: 3 hours (and counting...)
Tomorrow: Moving to next project while DSA fundamentals refresh - Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues revision for interview prep.
Building works.
Deploying teaches you the real problems.
Question: Do you build multiple small projects quickly or spend weeks perfecting deployment of one project?
