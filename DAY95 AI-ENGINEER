🧠 Day 95 The Machine Learning Developement Life Cycle 🚀
Today I explored the complete ML life cycle and now it all makes sense! 🔁
 It’s not just "train a model and done" it’s a journey of 9 steps:
1️⃣ Problem Framing
 2️⃣ Data Collection
 3️⃣ Data Preprocessing
 4️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 5️⃣ Feature Engineering
 6️⃣ Model Training
 7️⃣ Testing & Evaluation
 8️⃣ Optimization
 9️⃣ Deployment 💻🚀
And here’s where things got interesting:
I finally understood the difference between:
🔹 Data Analyst: Insights from past data
 🔹 Data Scientist: Builds predictive models from data
 🔹 Data Engineer: Builds the pipelines & infra to handle the data
 🔹 ML Engineer: Bridges Data Science ↔ Deployment
 🔹 AI Engineer: Basically a Data Scientist + Software Engineer combo 🧠💻
The overlap is real but the responsibilities? Very different.
I choose Ai from the very beginning.
lets cintunue on to learning !
