ðŸš€ Day 46 of hashtag#AI â€“ Linear Algebra Deep Dive ðŸŽ“
Today, I explored one of the most fundamental pillars of Machine Learning: Linear Algebra â€” and it's more exciting than I expected!
ðŸ’¡ What I Learned:
âœ… Implemented Gaussian Elimination in Python from scratch
 âœ… Mastered core Vector Algebra concepts:
Vector addition & scalar multiplication
Dot product (algebraic & geometric views)
Matrix-vector multiplication
How vectors and matrices relate to linear transformations
ðŸ”¬ Hands-on Practice:
ðŸ“Œ Completed a coding lab where I implemented:
Vector operations using NumPy
Step-by-step Gaussian Elimination
Explored matrix transformations and their geometric interpretation
ðŸ§  Why It Matters:
Understanding how data and operations are represented as vectors and matrices is crucial for everything from training machine learning models to interpreting PCA and neural networks.
Up next: Deeper into matrix transformations and preparing for applications in ML models!
