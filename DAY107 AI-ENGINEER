Today I discovered something that honestly made data preprocessing way less hectic : ColumnTransformer in sklearn.

📅 Day 107 of my AI Engineer Journey

Until now, whenever I had to encode multiple columns, I:
Did Label Encoding on some.
Did One-Hot on others.
And prayed I didn’t mix things up 😅.
With ColumnTransformer, I can apply different encodings to different columns all in one place. No messy code, no “did I already encode this?” moments.
My takeaway: Learning the right tool at the right time can save hours — and maybe a few headaches too.
Have you used ColumnTransformer before? Or do you prefer building separate pipelines?
