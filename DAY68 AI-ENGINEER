🔍 Day 68 – How Data Teaches Us to Make Confident Decisions

Today I took a deep dive into some powerful ideas behind hypothesis testing — not just the formulas, but the mindset and consequences behind every decision we make with data.

📌 Key Concepts I Covered:
✅ Significance Level (α):
The probability of making a Type 1 Error — rejecting the null hypothesis when it’s actually true. Most use 0.05, but I learned that the lower you go, the safer you are from false positives — yet the risk of missing real effects (Type 2 Error) increases.

✅ Type I vs Type II Errors:

Type I = False alarm

Type II = Missed opportunity
It’s a trade-off — one you must balance based on context.

✅ One-tailed vs Two-tailed Tests:

One-sided tests ask: “Is this better?”

Two-sided tests ask: “Is this different — in any way?”
→ More power vs more caution. The decision depends on your research question.

💡 What I loved most today:
The theory isn’t just abstract — I saw how hypothesis testing is used in:

A/B testing (marketing & product decisions)

Drug trials

Behavioral research

Business performance comparisons

Data doesn't speak until we ask the right questions — and hypothesis testing is one of the cleanest, most objective ways to do it.

Slow days or fast, I’m learning to think like a data scientist — and that’s the real win. 🧠📊
