🚀 Day 111 of my AI Engineer Journey

Today was a data cleaning marathon 🧹📊 — tackling messy, mixed, and missing data.

1️⃣ Mixed Data in a Single Column
Ever seen a column with both numbers and text?
Example: Titanic’s Ticket or Cabin column.
Solution → Split into separate columns for numeric & categorical parts.
✅ Easier to process, cleaner for models.

2️⃣ Date/Time Formatting
Dates can be gold for feature engineering (think: day, month, season).
I practiced extracting parts of date features and converting them to the right format.

3️⃣ Missing Data — Step 1 of Handling

Complete Case Analysis (CCA) → Remove rows/columns with missing values.

When to use: Only if missingness is completely at random & <5% missing.

Pros: Simple, no assumptions about missing values.

Cons: Can lose valuable data.

💡 Lesson learned:
Cleaning data isn’t just “preparation” — it’s where most of the real work happens.
A messy dataset is like a messy kitchen… cooking (modeling) gets way harder.

How do you usually deal with missing values — drop them, impute them, or something else?
