Day 57 — Back After Eid! 🌙
Eid Mubarak to everyone! Hope you all had a peaceful and joyful time. Blessings to you and your loved ones. 🌼

Back to learning! Today I revised density estimation:

🔹 “Density around 5 is 0.6” ≠ probability at 5.
To get actual probability, take an interval (like 4.9–5.1) and find the area under the curve.

Density Estimation:
Parametric: Assumes known distribution (e.g., Normal), uses parameters.

Non-parametric: No assumptions. Example → KDE (Kernel Density Estimation) — plots a curve for each point using a kernel like Gaussian.

Also reviewed:
📌 PDF = slope of CDF
📌 CDF = area under PDF

Back on track! 💪
