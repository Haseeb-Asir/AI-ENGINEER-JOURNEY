🔥 Day 33 of #100DaysOfAI 🔥
Today was super fun and honestly one of the most exciting days of my AI learning journey so far! 🎉

I worked with two fascinating datasets:
📊 Zomato – restaurant types, votes, and more
🌍 COVID-19 – global pandemic stats by country

What I did:
✅ Created interactive visualizations using Plotly & Plotly Express
✅ Built a Choropleth map to visualize COVID-19 spread across continents
✅ Used WordClouds to visualize popular condition groups & food types
✅ Explored deep relationships in data using advanced EDA techniques

📹 I even made a short walkthrough video of the results – check it out in the comments or my repo! It was not just a task — it was an experience that helped me learn a LOT, especially how visuals can tell powerful stories in data.

🧠 From maps to word clouds, from bars to heatmaps — this day really leveled up my data storytelling skills!

Let me know if you'd like the Jupyter Notebook or code – happy to share.
