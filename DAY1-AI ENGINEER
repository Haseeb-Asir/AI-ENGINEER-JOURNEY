# 🌱 Day 1 – My AI Journey Begins

## 📚 What I Learned Today

Today marks the beginning of my limitless journey into Python programming and Artificial Intelligence. Here’s a summary of foundational concepts I covered:

---

### 🔹 Python Basics & Background

- **Invented By**: Guido van Rossum  
- **First Released**: 1990 (conceptualized in the late 1980s)
- **Philosophy**: Simple, readable, and beginner-friendly syntax.

---

### 🔹 Key Features of Python

- 🧠 **High-Level Language** – Easy to understand and closer to human thinking  
- 💸 **Free and Open-Source** – Accessible to everyone  
- 🌐 **Portable** – Write once, run anywhere  
- 🔁 **Versatile** – Used in:
  - Web Development
  - Game Development
  - AI and Machine Learning
  - Data Science
  - Automation & Scripting

---

### 🔹 Python Typing System

- ✅ **Dynamically Typed** (implicit typing):  
  Python decides the data type at runtime.
  ```python
  x = 5  # Python automatically understands this is an int

###Syntax Essentials
#Keywords: Reserved words in Python (like if, else, return, etc.)

#Punctuators: Symbols used for structure (:, =, (), {}, etc.)

###🧠 Problem Solving (Codewars)
#I also practiced some bite-sized challenges to apply the concepts I learned.

#📌 Codewars Challenges Solved Today:
Double Values in a List (without loops)

Remove Exclamation Marks from End of String

Basic Mathematical Operations

Convert Number to Binary

Return the Day from a Number (1–7)

#💡 Solutions for each challenge are saved in the solutions/day1_codewars.py file.
