📅 Day 94 — ML Getting Spicier 🌶️
Started the day diving deeper into ML types…
✅ Learnt how ML is categorized:
 • Based on how it learns: Model-based vs Instance-based
 • Based on when it learns: Batch vs Online Learning
And guesss what!
Then I went into the real-world applications and just wow:
---------------------------
Ever wonder why stocks go up during elections?
 Some companies literally sell sentiment data to political firms or hedge funds. They create hype, drive attention, retail investors buy in...
 …and guess what? The big firms sell at the top. 📉
 ML is behind the scenes pulling strings.
-------------------------
ML is everywhere retail, finance, transport, ads, even that “recommended for you” section 👀
Also explored some ML challenges:
• Data quality drama
• Biased models
• “Too much math, not enough data” moments 😵‍💫
But guess what?
It’s messy.
It’s exciting.
And I’m loving it 😎
Let’s keep building — brick by buggy brick.
