🧠 Day 39 of #100DaysOfAI
Today I learned about Derived Metrics — a powerful technique to extract new insights by creating new variables from existing ones!

🔹 What are Derived Metrics?
They’re features we create from original data to reveal hidden patterns. One such technique I explored is:

📊 Feature Binning
This means converting numerical values into categorical bins.
Example: Convert Ages like 25, 7, 34... into bins like 0-10, 10-20, etc.

📌 Types of Binning:
🔹 Unsupervised Binning (No target variable used):
Equal Width Binning: Divide the range into equal-sized intervals.

Equal Frequency Binning: Each bin has (almost) the same number of data points.

🔸 Supervised Binning (Target variable is used):
Entropy-Based Binning: Uses decision tree logic to find the best splits based on class purity (0s vs 1s).

🔍 Why is this useful?
Feature binning helps models understand non-linear relationships, reduces noise, and improves interpretability — especially when dealing with tree-based models or rule-based logic.

📈 Can’t wait to apply this to real data sets!
