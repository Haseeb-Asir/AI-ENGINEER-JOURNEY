Day 179 of my AI Engineer Journey
Today's implementation:
I learned why XGBoost dominates Kaggle competitions and discovered it's not just an algorithm - it's an engineering masterpiece.
The process:

Studied XGBoost's origin story (Tianqi Chen, 2016)
Compared speed: Gradient Boosting vs XGBoost on same dataset
Implemented linear search vs binary search for DSA
Tested O(n) vs O(log n) performance differences

What I learned:
Speed comparison on 100k rows:

Gradient Boosting: 45 seconds
XGBoost: 3 seconds
Same accuracy, 15x faster!

Why XGBoost wins:
1. Engineering optimizations:

Parallel processing (uses all CPU cores)
Cache-aware access patterns
Out-of-core computing for massive datasets

2. Algorithm improvements:

Regularization built-in (L1 and L2)
Handles missing values automatically
Tree pruning using max_depth backwards

3. Flexibility features:

Custom loss functions
Multiple programming languages (Python, R, Java, C++)
Integrates with scikit-learn, Spark, Dask

Key insight:
XGBoost is library not algorithm - it's Gradient Boosting optimized through years of production experience and competition feedback
DSA breakthrough:
Binary search requires sorted array but delivers O(log n) vs O(n) for linear search.

Linear search 1M items: 1000ms
Binary search 1M items: 20ms

Tomorrow: XGBoost implementation from scratch and understanding tree pruning mechanism.
Speed matters in production.
Accuracy means nothing if training takes days.
Question: Do you optimize for accuracy first or speed first when building ML models?
