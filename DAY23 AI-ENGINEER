ðŸ“… Slow but steady progress!

Today I started exploring Tkinter â€” Python's standard GUI toolkit. It's fascinating to see how I can now add graphical interfaces to my Python projects after learning the core programming concepts!

ðŸ§± Covered:

Introduction to Tkinter widgets

Basics of creating windows, labels, and buttons

Played with layout managers (pack, grid, place)

ðŸ“Œ Taking it a bit slow due to university load, but I'm staying consistent. Even small progress is still progress!

ðŸ§  Also solved some fun problems on Codewars to keep my problem-solving sharp!
