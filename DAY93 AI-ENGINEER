🚀 Day 93  Finally... the Day Has Come! 🎉
After 3 solid months of mastering Basics for AI, I’ve officially stepped into the world of Machine Learning!
 And honestly... it feels AMAZING!!!
📚 Today I covered:
🔹 What is Machine Learning?
 🔹 ML vs AI vs DL – finally cleared the confusion!

 🔹 The 4 Major Types of ML:

 🔸 Supervised
 🔸 Unsupervised
 🔸 Semi-supervised
 🔸 Reinforcement learning

Got a basic understanding of each – and wow, the potential of ML is just mind-blowing! 🔍🧠

This is going to be one wild, insightful, and rewarding ride  and I’m here for it 💪🔥
