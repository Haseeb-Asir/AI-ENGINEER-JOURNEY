ðŸ”¹ Day 48 of 112 | AI Engineer Journey
Today was all about deepening my understanding of Linear Algebra â€” a foundational pillar for AI & Machine Learning.

ðŸ“Œ What I learned today:

ðŸŽ¥ Videos Covered:

Week 4 Introduction

Singularity and Rank of Linear Transformations

Determinant as Area

Determinant of a Product

Determinants of Inverses

Bases in Linear Algebra

Span in Linear Algebra

ðŸ“– Readings & Tools:

Checked my understanding through a knowledge quiz

Explored an interactive tool on Linear Span to visualize how vectors can form new spaces.

ðŸ§  Key Concepts:

Singularity & Rank â€” How linear transformations can collapse space and how to measure their "effectiveness"

Determinants â€” Not just a number, but a geometric tool to understand area scaling and invertibility

Basis & Span â€” The building blocks of vector spaces. Learned how a few vectors can generate entire dimensions!

ðŸ”— These topics are essential as they shape how data is transformed in neural networks and influence optimization techniques in AI.
