Day 129 + 130 of my AI Engineer Journey
Linear algebra exam destroyed me yesterday.
Hard. Brutal. Mind-melting.
But ultimately... it made today's gradient descent implementation make perfect sense.
Most people learn gradient descent wrong:
→ "Let's optimize both M and B simultaneously."
→ "Here's the complex multi-variable calculus."
→ "Use this black-box formula from the internet."
But anyone who's struggled through linear algebra knows there's a better approach.
What actually works for learning?
Start simple. Build complexity gradually:

Day 129 approach: Fix M = 78.35, optimize only B (intercept)
Single variable optimization → easier to visualize and debug
Manual implementation of the slope calculation (not black-box)
Real dataset testing to see if the math actually works
Custom gradient descent class built from scratch

The implementation:
pythonB_new = B_old - learning_rate * slope
Where slope = derivative of mean squared error with respect to B.
What I discovered:

Fixing M first makes the math crystal clear
You can actually SEE gradient descent working on one variable
Building your own class > using someone else's black box
Linear algebra exam pain → gradient descent gain

The reality?
That brutal linear algebra exam yesterday wasn't punishment. It was preparation.
Every derivative, every matrix operation - they all connect to this moment.
Tomorrow: Adding M optimization to make it complete multi-variable gradient descent.
Sometimes you need to break things down to the simplest piece.
Then build back up.
Question: When learning complex algorithms, do you start with the full complexity or break it into the smallest possible pieces first?
