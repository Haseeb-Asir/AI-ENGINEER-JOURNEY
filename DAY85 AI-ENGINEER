📊 Day 85 – Probability Distributions, Transformations, and CLT!
 Today, I Revised some critical probability distributions. practiced Python-coded versions using NumPy, SciPy, and sklearn.
🔍 Distributions Revised Today (with code 💻):
🔹 Uniform Distribution
 – All outcomes equally likely
 – Discrete or continuous
 – Example: Dice rolls, coin toss, or initializing ML weights
 – Coded via np.random.uniform() or scipy.stats.uniform
🔹 Log-Normal Distribution
 – Log of variable is normally distributed
 – Used to model right-skewed data like comment counts or chess game lengths
 – QQ plot of log(x) reveals normality
 – Coded with scipy.stats.lognorm
🔹 Pareto Distribution
 – Power-law behavior (80/20 rule)
 – Models wealth distribution, social network reach, etc.
 – Use log-log plots or QQ plots to test
 – scipy.stats.pareto is your friend for code
🔹 Bernoulli Distribution
 – Binary outcome: success (1) or failure (0)
 – Single trial → scipy.stats.bernoulli(p)
 – Example: spam detection (spam vs. not spam)
🔹 Binomial Distribution
 – Repeated Bernoulli trials
 – Models # of successes in n trials
 – Used in hypothesis testing & classification
 – Coded using scipy.stats.binom(n, p)
🔄 Data Transformation Techniques (to normalize skewed data):
Used to make data closer to normal distribution — critical for algorithms assuming normality!
🔸 FunctionTransformer in sklearn.preprocessing
 – log, reciprocal, square, sqrt transforms
🔸 PowerTransformer
 – Box-Cox: Only positive values
 – Yeo-Johnson: Works with negative & zero too
💡 Real Use: Preprocessing for Linear Regression, SVM, Logistic Regression, etc.
📦 Sampling Distribution
Instead of analyzing one sample, we study statistics from many samples.
 Use case: If you collect average salaries from 100 different 50-person samples, the distribution of those means is your sampling distribution.
🔥 Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
Even if population data is NOT normally distributed, the sampling distribution of the mean tends to become normal, provided:
 – Sample size ≥ 30
 – Random, i.i.d variables
 – Finite population/variance

I’ve covered the foundational theory, coding, and visual checks (like QQ plots, histograms, log-log plots) to confidently tackle real-world data.
