📅 Day 103 of My AI Journey

Today I entered one of the most powerful phases of the Machine Learning Development Cycle:
🚀 Feature Engineering

Why is this step crucial?
Because your model is only as good as your features. Even with a simple algorithm, well-engineered features can massively boost performance.

🔍 What I learnt today:
Feature Engineering isn't just one thing — it's a systematic set of steps that shape raw data into smart signals. Here's the breakdown:

1️⃣ Feature Transformation
(Scaling, normalization, encoding... giving structure and meaning to raw input)

2️⃣ Feature Construction
(Creating new features from existing ones — like combining date fields to get age, etc.)

3️⃣ Feature Selection
(Removing irrelevant/noisy features — keeping only what matters)

4️⃣ Feature Extraction
(Dimensionality reduction — pulling out the essence, e.g., PCA)

✨ From tomorrow onward, I’ll dive into each part in depth with code and projects.

🎯 The goal: Learn to craft clean, informative, and high-impact features that machines can actually learn from.
