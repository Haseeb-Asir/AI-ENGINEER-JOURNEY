ðŸš€ Day 52: Back on Track â€” Even After Setbacks
After a few tough days and the heartbreaking loss of my cousin ðŸ’”, I finally found the strength to get back on track with my AI Engineer journey.
Today, I dove into Statistics for Machine Learning, and it reminded me why I started this in the first place â€” to grow, to learn, and to build something meaningful.
ðŸ“˜ Topics Covered â€“ Statistics for ML.
What is Statistics?

ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways:
Statistics is the backbone of machine learning.
Understanding how to describe and interpret data is foundational before diving into models.
Even on difficult days, showing up matters.
ðŸ“… Day 52 done. Onward and upward.
I willl be following the youtube course by CampusX . I will share the notes for it on GitHub.
