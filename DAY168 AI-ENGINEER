Days 167-168 of my AI Engineer Journey
Today's implementation:
I spent 2 days deriving the mathematical foundation of Gradient Boosting and finally understood why it's called "gradient" boosting.
The process:

Derived loss function gradient for MSE (Mean Squared Error)
Understood why we fit trees to negative gradients
Coded complete gradient boosting from mathematical principles
Practiced implementation on regression problems

The Mathematical Breakthrough:
Loss Function (MSE):
L = (1/n) Σ(yᵢ - F(xᵢ))²
Gradient with respect to predictions:
∂L/∂F(xᵢ) = -2(yᵢ - F(xᵢ))/n = -2 × residual/n
Why "Gradient" Boosting:

Traditional gradient descent: Update parameters in direction of negative gradient
Gradient boosting: Fit new model to negative gradient (residuals!)
Each tree predicts the negative gradient direction of the loss function

The Key Insight:
Residuals ARE the negative gradients of MSE loss function. When we fit trees to residuals, we're literally performing gradient descent in function space.
Mathematical Formula:
F_m(x) = F_(m-1)(x) + learning_rate × h_m(x)
Where:

F_m(x) = Current ensemble prediction
h_m(x) = New tree fitted to residuals (negative gradients)
learning_rate = Step size (typically 0.01-0.1)

Why it generalizes:
By changing the loss function, we can use gradient boosting for any differentiable objective:

Regression: MSE, MAE, Huber loss
Classification: Log loss (cross-entropy)
Ranking: Custom ranking losses

Tomorrow: XGBoost - regularization terms and second-order gradients (Newton's method).
Gradient descent in function space.
Not optimizing parameters, optimizing predictions.
Question: Do you find mathematical derivations helpful for understanding algorithms or do you prefer intuitive explanations?
