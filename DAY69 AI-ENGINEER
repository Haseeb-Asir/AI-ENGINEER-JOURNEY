📈 Day 69 – Hypothesis Testing in Real ML Applications

Theory becomes powerful when it meets real-world machine learning.
Today I explored how hypothesis testing supports the decisions we often take for granted in AI workflows:

🧠 Applications I Learned:
Model Comparison
→ Use paired t-tests to check if Model A is actually better than Model B, or just lucky on one fold.

Feature Selection
→ Use t-tests, ANOVA, or chi-square to see which features really contribute to the target — not just look good.

Hyperparameter Tuning
→ Statistically compare models with different hyperparameters, not just based on one accuracy value.

Validating Model Assumptions
→ In regression models, use hypothesis tests to check if residuals are normal or if linearity holds.

🔍 P-Value — The Real Decision-Maker
I also studied the P-Value Approach, which gives us the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis:

p < 0.01 → Strong evidence

0.01 < p < 0.05 → Moderate

0.05 < p < 0.1 → Weak

p > 0.1 → No real evidence

It’s not just about rejecting H₀ — it’s about understanding how confident we are in doing so.

🧪 Case Study 1:
A company runs a training program and wants to test if employee scores improved.

H₀: Training has no effect

H₁: Training improves performance
→ Using a paired t-test on before/after scores helped determine statistical significance.

🧪 Case Study 2:
Lays claims its chips weigh exactly 50g.
We sample 30 packets.

H₀: Mean weight = 50g

H₁: Mean weight ≠ 50g
→ Conducting a two-tailed test reveals whether the claim holds.

Learning to question data like a scientist, while building like an engineer. That’s the kind of AI mindset I’m shaping, one day at a time. 💻📊
