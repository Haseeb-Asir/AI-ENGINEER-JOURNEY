🚀 Day 42 of #100DaysOfAI

Today I completed the full EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) on the Customer Churn dataset, continuing from where I left off yesterday.

🔍 What I covered:
✅ Basic EDA
✅ Data cleaning (handling missing values, correcting data types, feature binning)
✅ Univariate analysis (individual feature distributions)
✅ Bivariate analysis (exploring relationships between features and churn)
✅ Numerical analysis (correlation, KDE plots, scatter plots)

📊 Tools:

Pandas for data wrangling

Seaborn & Matplotlib for visualization

NumPy for transformations


💡 Key Takeaways:
I've learned not just to explore the data — but how to prepare it for machine learning models:
✔ Cleaning the dataset
✔ Transforming target variables
✔ Understanding which features affect churn
✔ Finding meaningful patterns to guide feature selection
