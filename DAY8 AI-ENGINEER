Day 8 Progress: Recovering & Advancing with File I/O & Recursion!
After recovering from a brief illness, I’m back to tackling my Python journey! Today’s focus was on File I/O and Recursion. Here’s what I’ve accomplished:

File I/O
Learned how to handle files in Python with read and write operations.

Explored text vs binary mode and how to handle errors while working with files.

Worked through interview questions related to File I/O to deepen my understanding, including:

How to efficiently read large datasets.

Error handling during file operations.

Recursion
Continued reviewing and solving recursion problems, especially related to the Fibonacci sequence.

Strengthened my grasp of base cases, recursive cases, and the importance of stack management.

Solved various problems on Codewars, focusing on recursion and its real-world applications.

Codewars & Problem-Solving
Solved several problems testing recursion and File I/O concepts.

Took note of any areas that need improvement, reinforcing my skills for the next phase.

I’m excited to continue building on these skills and looking forward to the next challenges!
