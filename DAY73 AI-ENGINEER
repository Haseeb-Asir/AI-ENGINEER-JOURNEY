📘 Day 73 Revission Session.
Tomorrow is my last midterm exam, so I kept things light today.
 Instead of pushing ahead, I revised all the hypothesis testing methods I’ve learned so far — from Z-test, T-test, Chi-Square to ANOVA and reinforced the concepts.
Not every day has to be fast-paced. Sometimes, pausing and reviewing is the best kind of progress.
Back to full momentum after tomorrow, inshaAllah! 🚀
 Grateful for the journey so far 🙏
Ive uploaded all the maths study material on Github.
Do check it out.I hope it will be helpful.
