ðŸš€ Day 109 of my AI Engineer Journey

Todayâ€™s focus: Power Transformer magic âœ¨

Tried out Box-Cox & Yeo-Johnson transformations (default in PowerTransformer) to tackle skewed data.

What I did:

Used Titanic dataset ðŸ›³

Applied transformations to Age & Fare

Ran models before and after transformation

Compared accuracy for Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree

What I found:

Box-Cox works best when all values are positive ðŸ“ˆ

Yeo-Johnson handles zero & negative values too

Both can make distributions way closer to normal â€” helping some models perform better

ðŸ’¡ Lesson learned:
Small preprocessing steps like this can be the difference between a mediocre model and a great one.

Do you usually transform skewed features before training?
