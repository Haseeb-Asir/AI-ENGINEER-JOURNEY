**Day 190 of my AI Engineer Journey - Quick Update**

Mid-semester exams start tomorrow.

Back to the grind. Study mode activated.

**The reality:**
189 days of consistent ML learning, but academic commitments come first.

**What I've covered so far:**
- Linear/Logistic Regression fundamentals
- Ensemble methods (Bagging, Boosting, Stacking)
- XGBoost mathematical derivations
- Clustering algorithms (K-Means, DBSCAN)
- Imbalanced data handling
- Complete DSA fundamentals

**What's left:**
1 final ML algorithm to complete the journey.

**Exam break:** Oct 30 - Nov 8

**Back:** November 9th with the final algorithm and ML journey completion.

189 consecutive days of learning.

Pausing, not stopping.

See you November 9th! 🚀
