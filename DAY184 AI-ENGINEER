ðŸš€ Day 184: Deep Dive into XGBoost Mathematics!

Continuing the rigorous derivation of the XGBoost objective function today! 

We've hit a major milestone: successfully applying the second-order Taylor Series expansion to the loss function.
 This pivotal step has yielded the reduced form of the objective function, which is now clearly expressed in terms of the first-order gradient and the second-order Hessian of the loss function.
This is the mathematical core that allows XGBoost to be so efficient and accurate!

Tomorrow, we'll focus on the final simplification: combining the resulting two summations into the classic, streamlined form of the XGBoost objective function for a new tree.

Challenging but incredibly rewarding work to understand the engine under the hood of this powerful algorithm! ðŸ’ª
