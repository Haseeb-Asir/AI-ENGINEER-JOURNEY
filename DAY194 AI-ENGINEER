Day 194 of my AI Engineer Journey
Today's implementation:
I learned email spam classification architecture through CampusX and discovered why Naive Bayes still dominates this 20-year-old problem.
The process:

Studied spam classifier pipeline from YouTube tutorial
Learned text preprocessing: lowercasing, tokenization, stopword removal
Understood why TF-IDF + Naive Bayes = 98% accuracy
Started learning Streamlit for deployment

What I learned:
Why spam detection is perfect for Naive Bayes:

High-dimensional sparse data (thousands of word features)
Independence assumption works well for text
Fast training and prediction
Handles imbalanced datasets naturally (90% ham, 10% spam)

The spam classification pipeline:

Text preprocessing:

Lowercase: "FREE" → "free"
Remove special characters and numbers
Tokenization: Split into words
Remove stopwords: "the", "is", "at"
Stemming: "winning" → "win"


Feature extraction:

TF-IDF vectorization
Converts text to numerical features
Captures word importance


Model training:

Multinomial Naive Bayes
Learns word "spamicity" scores
P(spam | "free") vs P(ham | "free")


Deployment with Streamlit:

Simple Python web framework
Input text box → Predict button → Spam/Ham result
Deploy in minutes, not days



Spam red flags learned:

Words: "free", "winner", "claim", "urgent", "congratulations"
ALL CAPS text
Multiple exclamation marks!!!
Suspicious URLs

Streamlit discovery:
Learned about streamlit - creates web apps in pure Python, no HTML/CSS/JavaScript needed!
Simple syntax:
pythonimport streamlit as st
text = st.text_area("Enter email")
if st.button("Check Spam"):
    prediction = model.predict(text)
    st.write(f"Result: {prediction}")
Tomorrow: Implementing complete spam classifier with Streamlit deployment, testing on real emails.
20-year-old algorithm.
Still unbeaten for spam detection.
Question: Do you prefer learning through documentation or watching video tutorials when building projects?
