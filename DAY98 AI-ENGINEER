📅 Day 98 of AI Journey
Finally got my brain buzzing with real-world machine learning thinking + practical data handling!!!

Part 1: Problem Framing like a Netflix ML Engineer:
Today I watched a video where they framed Netflix’s goal of increasing revenue into an actual ML problem:
 ➡️ Reduce churn from 4% to 3.75%
 ➡️ Predict users likely to leave → Binary Classification
 ➡️ Predict probability of churn → Regression

What I learned:
1.Problem → ML Framing
2.Define Data Needs (watch time, buffering, payment history, etc.)
3.Choose Model Type(supervised --> regression in this case)
4.Check for regional/data biases
5.Define the right metrics
6.Use offline /online learning (practical for big companies like Netflix)
This gave me a full blueprint of how data scientists + ML engineers think.

Part 2: Got My Hands Dirty with CSV Data Handling in Python!
➡️ Watched an in-depth practical video and learned:
➡️ What are CSV and TSV files
➡️ How to load them using pd.read_csv()

**Some important parameters in pd.read_csv() function:
➡️ sep – (Separator, default is ','; use '\t' for TSV)
➡️ names – (List of column names if no header row in file)
➡️ usecols – (Load only specific columns by name/index)
➡️ index_col – (Set one or more columns as index)
➡️ header – (Row number(s) to use as column names; use None if no header)
➡️ skiprows – (Skip first n rows; or pass list of row indices to skip)
➡️ nrows – (Read only the first n rows — good for preview/testing)
➡️ encoding – (Specify file encoding like 'utf-8', 'ISO-8859-1', etc.)
➡️ squeeze – (If the file has only 1 column, return as Series)
➡️ dtype – (Force data types per column: {'col': type})
➡️ parse_dates – (Parse date columns to datetime format)
➡️ converters – (Apply custom function to transform column values)
➡️ na_values – (Treat certain strings like 'NA', '?', 'missing' as NaN)
➡️ on_bad_lines – ('error', 'skip', 'warn'; new way to handle bad lines)
➡️ chunksize – (Read file in chunks of rows; returns iterator — used for big data)

From local files to URLs, from encoding errors to big data processing, I now feel confident handling the #1 skill in ML: working with real data.
🔗 All this has helped me mentally map the real flow of a machine learning project
 📈 Not just the code, but the mindset behind it.
 💬 From business objectives → data logic → modeling steps → real-world deployment thinking.

If you’re learning AI/ML, don’t just chase models—
Learn the data + ask the right questions.
