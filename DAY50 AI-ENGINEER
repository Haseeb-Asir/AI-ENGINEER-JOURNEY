📍 Day 50 of 112 – AI Engineer Journey

Even while on my trip, I made sure to stay committed. 🌍💻
Today, I revised the entire Linear Algebra course for AI/ML and reviewed all the concepts I've covered so far in my learning journey. ✅📚

Revisiting these foundations reminded me how far I’ve come — and how important consistency is, no matter where you are.
Excited to return stronger in 2 days! 💪
