Days 136-137 of my AI Engineer Journey
Finals are done. Semester over.
Burned out. Empty. Needed a break.
But ultimately... one day off was all I could handle before the coding itch returned.
After finals, most people do this:
‚Üí "Time for a week-long Netflix marathon."
‚Üí "My brain is fried, no learning for at least a month."
‚Üí "I deserve complete rest from anything academic."
But anyone truly passionate about coding knows rest means something different.
What post-finals recovery taught me?
Sometimes the best break is doing what you love:

Day 136: Absolutely nothing - slept, ate, stared at ceiling
Tried to relax completely - but kept thinking about gradient descent
Day 137 afternoon: Gave up pretending to rest, opened my laptop
The urge: Code batch gradient descent from scratch without tutorials

Challenge accepted:
Build my own version and compare it to sklearn's LinearRegression().
My from-scratch batch gradient descent:

Initialize all betas to zero
Calculate gradients using ENTIRE dataset
Update all parameters simultaneously
Repeat for fixed epochs

The comparison moment:
My Implementation:

Œ≤‚ÇÄ (intercept): 1.847
Œ≤‚ÇÅ (feature1): 0.623
Œ≤‚ÇÇ (feature2): 0.891
Training time: 847ms

Sklearn LinearRegression:

Œ≤‚ÇÄ: 1.847
Œ≤‚ÇÅ: 0.623
Œ≤‚ÇÇ: 0.891
Training time: 12ms

Results: IDENTICAL. Speed: sklearn destroyed me. üòÖ
The realization:
True rest isn't avoiding what you love. It's doing it without pressure.
Tomorrow: Why is sklearn 70x faster? Time to investigate optimized implementations.
Sometimes the best recovery is returning to what excites you.
Not because you have to.
Because you want to.
Question: After a stressful period, do you prefer complete disconnection or returning to what you're passionate about?
