I had to come out and say it:
Most "gradient descent" explanations today are garbage.
Overcomplicated. Mathematical jargon. Confusing.
But ultimately... they miss the simple truth.
Scroll any ML tutorial and you'll see:
→ "Here's the partial derivative of the cost function."
→ "Understand the mathematical proof first."
→ "Let me show you 15 different variants of gradient descent."
But anyone who's actually implemented it knows this isn't how you learn it.
What gradient descent actually is?
The simplest optimization idea ever:

Give it any differentiable function → it finds the lowest point
Non-closed form solution for finding m and b in linear regression
Works on countless ML techniques
The backbone of deep learning - every neural network uses this
Simple logic: go downhill until you can't go lower

Day 126 reality:
I learned gradient descent today. Not the heavy math first - the intuition.
It's just: "Keep adjusting your guess until you stop getting better results."
That's it.

Want to minimize error in linear regression? Gradient descent.
Training a neural network? Gradient descent.
Optimizing any ML algorithm? Gradient descent.

University finals start tomorrow (Sept 1-9), so taking a study break - but the AI learning continues with small daily lectures.
The simple truth?
Gradient descent isn't complex math. It's just smart guessing with direction.
Avoid the mathematical intimidation.
Understand the intuition first.
Question: Did you learn gradient descent through heavy math or simple intuition first?
