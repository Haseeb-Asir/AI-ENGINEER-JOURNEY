📅 Day 101 of My AI Journey

Today I moved into Step 3 of the ML Development Lifecycle – Understanding Data 📊

🔍 What I covered:
1️⃣ Understanding Basics – getting familiar with dataset structure, types of variables, and initial sanity checks.
2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Univariate Analysis – studying each feature individually.
3️⃣ Applied different plots based on data type:

Box plots 📦 – spotting outliers

Histograms 📈 – seeing distribution patterns

Pie charts 🥧 – showing proportions

Count plots 📊 – for categorical feature frequency

💡 Practice dataset: FIFA World Cup data – perfect for spotting patterns in player stats & team performance.

This step is crucial because a good ML model starts with truly understanding your data—it’s like knowing your battlefield before the war. ⚔️
