Day 174 of my AI Engineer Journey
Today's implementation:
I derived the complete mathematical formulation of Hard Margin SVM and discovered why it's a quadratic optimization problem, not gradient descent.
The process:

Derived the primal problem: min(||w||²/2)
Converted to dual problem using Lagrange multipliers
Understood why we need constraints: yᵢ(w·xᵢ + b) ≥ 1
Coded the optimization from mathematical principles

What I learned:
The margin width = 2/||w||, so maximizing margin = minimizing ||w||²
Hard Margin SVM formulation:

Objective: Minimize (1/2)||w||²
Constraint: For all points, yᵢ(w·xᵢ + b) ≥ 1
Solution: Quadratic programming (not gradient descent!)

Why Lagrange multipliers:
The dual formulation reveals that only support vectors (points where constraint is tight) matter - all other αᵢ = 0!
Key insight:
Hard margin only works for perfectly linearly separable data. One outlier breaks the entire optimization - constraint becomes unsatisfiable.
The mathematical beauty:
Support vectors are points where yᵢ(w·xᵢ + b) = 1 exactly. Moving these changes the hyperplane, moving others doesn't.
Weekend DSA restart:
Getting back to data structures after heavy ML theory week.
Tomorrow: Soft Margin SVM - adding slack variables ξᵢ to handle non-separable data and outliers.
Perfect separability is a mathematical luxury.
Real data needs flexibility.
Question: Do you prefer algorithms with strict mathematical guarantees or flexible heuristics that handle messy data?
