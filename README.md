# AI-ENGINEER-JOURNEY


# üöÄ From Python Basics to AI Engineer ‚Äì A Limitless Journey
HELLO , MY NAME IS MUHAMMAD HASEEB ASIR .IM CURRENTLY PURSUING BACHELORS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE .IM AN  ASPIRING AI ENGINEER WHO OPTS TO BE BY THIS YEARS END. MY JOURNEY DETAILS FOR THIS GOAL ARE AS FOLLOWS:

Welcome to my evolving journey into the world of **Artificial Intelligence** ‚Äì where I begin with Python fundamentals and grow all the way to building intelligent systems and real-world AI projects.

This repository is a personal log, practice ground, and showcase of everything I learn along the way ‚Äî structured, consistent, and deeply hands-on.I will include notes , problems (commonly asked in interviews and platforms like Codewars, HackerRank etc)

Whether you're starting from scratch or brushing up your skills, I hope this inspires you to build relentlessly and **never stop learning**.

## Resources 
-I will be learning python from youtube 12 hour course from Apna college , Programming by MOsh, Edureka's course as well as Freecodecamp. All these combined and common points from all.
-For practice i will solve problems on Codewars then proceeding to Leetcode when I start DSA
-For DSA i will use Coursera courses i will menytion along the way
-AI machine learning will be covered in AI engineer specializition by IBM course on Coursera 

## üß† Why This Repo?

I believe consistency beats intensity. This repo reflects my daily commitment to:
- Sharpen core programming skills  
- Build strong foundations in data structures and algorithms  
- Master essential AI tools and libraries  
- Explore machine learning and deep learning techniques  
- Create real-world, impact-driven AI projects

Each folder documents what I learn, build, and improve ‚Äî **problem-solving, code, and takeaways** ‚Äî all in one place.


## üå± Learning Phases

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Phase 1: Python & DSA** | Mastering the core of programming with Python, problem-solving, and data structures + algorithms. |
| **Phase 2: Libraries & Math** | Learning essential libraries (NumPy, pandas, matplotlib) along with linear algebra, statistics, and probability. |
| **Phase 3: Machine Learning & Deep Learning** | Getting hands-on with supervised and unsupervised learning, neural networks, and foundational ML theory. |
| **Phase 4: AI Projects** | Building production-ready projects ‚Äî from AI bots to web apps, model deployment, and end-to-end systems. |
