# 🚀 Python to AI Engineer: A 112-Day Journey

Welcome to my **daily coding repository** documenting my transition from Python fundamentals to advanced AI engineering. This is a hands-on, no-fluff, practice-first approach built over **112 days**, starting from April 10, 2025.

## 🧠 Why This Repo?

As an aspiring AI Engineer, I’m building my foundations through daily structured practice. This repo is a **living archive** of the challenges I tackle—from basic Python to data structures, algorithms, and machine learning essentials.

Whether you're a beginner looking for direction or someone pursuing AI like me, I hope this inspires you to stay consistent and think big.
