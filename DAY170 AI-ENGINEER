Day 170 of my AI Engineer Journey
Today's implementation:
I learned stacking ensemble - the most powerful but complex ensemble method that won countless Kaggle competitions.
The process:

Understood stacking architecture: base models + meta-learner
Discovered the train-test data leakage problem in naive stacking
Learned two solutions: blending and k-fold stacking
DSA on hold due to heavy ML schedule

What is Stacking:
Stacking uses a meta-learning algorithm to learn how to best combine predictions from two or more base machine learning algorithms
Architecture:

Level 0: Multiple diverse base models (SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost)
Level 1: Meta-learner trained on base model predictions
Meta-model combines base model predictions to get final forecast

The Critical Problem:
Training meta-model on same data used to train base models = data leakage = overfitting
Solution 1 - Blending (Hold-out Method):
Meta-model trained on predictions made by base models on hold-out validation set

Split data: 70% train, 30% hold-out
Train base models on 70%
Generate predictions on 30% hold-out
Train meta-learner on these hold-out predictions
Simple but wastes 30% of training data

Solution 2 - K-Fold Stacking:
Most common approach uses k-fold cross-validation of base models, where out-of-fold predictions form training dataset for meta-model
Process:

Split data into k folds (e.g., 5 folds)
For each fold: train base models on k-1 folds, predict on held-out fold
Out-of-fold predictions are made on test sets not used to train the model
Stack all out-of-fold predictions as meta-features
Train meta-learner on these stacked predictions
Uses 100% of data efficiently!

Key insight:
K-fold stacking solves data leakage while using all training data. Each prediction is made on data the base model hasn't seen.
Tomorrow: XGBoost finally - the gradient boosting on steroids that dominates competitions.
Multiple levels of learning.
Base models see data, meta-model sees patterns.
Question: Do you prefer simple solutions that waste data (blending) or complex solutions that maximize data usage (k-fold stacking)?
