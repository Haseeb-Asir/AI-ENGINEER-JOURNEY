Day 160 of my AI Engineer Journey
Today's implementation:
Back from apartment chaos. Dove straight into bagging and finally understood why it's called "bootstrap aggregating."
The process:

Implemented bagging from scratch on iris dataset
Tested bootstrapping with random sampling (with replacement)
Combined predictions from multiple decision trees
Compared variance reduction across ensemble sizes

What I learned:

Bagging = Bootstrapping + Aggregation
Bootstrap: Random sampling with replacement creates diverse training sets
Each model trains on different data subset (same algorithm, different data)
Aggregation: Majority vote (classification) or mean (regression)

Why bagging works:
Based on bias-variance tradeoff:

Choose base model with low bias (like deep decision trees)
Individual models have high variance (sensitive to data changes)
Averaging multiple high-variance models reduces overall variance
Result: Low bias + low variance = better generalization

Bagging variants discovered:

Pasting: Row sampling without replacement
Random Subspaces: Column sampling (feature selection)
Random Patches: Both row + column sampling simultaneously

Key insight:
If you add new data points, no single model captures all changes. But ensemble average smooths out individual model variations.
Tomorrow: Implementing BaggingClassifier and BaggingRegressor from sklearn, plus understanding out-of-bag error estimation.
Multiple perspectives on same problem.
Each sees differently, together see clearly.
Question: When making important decisions, do you trust one expert's deep analysis or multiple specialists' combined opinions?
