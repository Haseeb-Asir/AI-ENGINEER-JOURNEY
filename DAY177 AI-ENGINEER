Day 177 of my AI Engineer Journey
Today's implementation:
I learned Naive Bayes and discovered why it's called "naive" - it breaks impossible calculations into simple multiplications.
The process:

Built cricket match predictor (toss + venue + weather → win/loss)
Tested query: "Match in Dubai, weather overcast"
Calculated P(Win|Dubai, Overcast) vs P(Loss|Dubai, Overcast)
Implemented hash table load factor optimization for DSA

What I learned:
The impossible problem:
Calculate P(Dubai, Overcast | Win) - but this exact combination might never appear in training data!
The "naive" solution:
Break it down: P(Dubai | Win) × P(Overcast | Win)
Assumes Dubai and weather are independent - obviously wrong in reality, but mathematically simple.
Bayes theorem application:
P(Win | Query) = P(Query | Win) × P(Win) / P(Query)
Key insight: P(Query) denominator is same for Win and Loss, so we ignore it!
Just compare: P(Query | Win) × P(Win) vs P(Query | Loss) × P(Loss)
Example calculation:

P(Dubai | Win) = 15/50 = 0.30
P(Overcast | Win) = 20/50 = 0.40
P(Win) = 50/100 = 0.50
Result: 0.30 × 0.40 × 0.50 = 0.06
P(Dubai | Loss) = 5/50 = 0.10
P(Overcast | Loss) = 10/50 = 0.20
P(Loss) = 50/100 = 0.50
Result: 0.10 × 0.20 × 0.50 = 0.01

Verdict: Win! (0.06 > 0.01)
DSA breakthrough:
Solved hash table load factor problem - when filled slots exceed 70%, performance degrades. Solution: resize and rehash.
Tomorrow: Mathematical derivation of Bayes theorem and conditional probability formulas.
Independence assumption is wrong.
But multiplication is easy.
Question: Do you prefer making accurate complex calculations or approximate simple ones that work 90% of the time?
