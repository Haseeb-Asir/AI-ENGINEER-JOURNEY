Days 199-201 of my AI Engineer Journey
Today's implementation:
I built an end-to-end car price prediction model with Streamlit deployment. The brutal reality: 85% of time spent on data cleaning, 15% on actual modeling.
The process:

3 days building complete ML pipeline from raw data to deployed app
Data cleaning and feature extraction: 2.5 days
Model training and tuning: 0.5 days
Tested 5+ algorithms, ensemble of XGBoost + Random Forest won

What I learned:
The 85/15 rule nobody tells you:

Data cleaning: 85% of project time
Feature engineering: Included in that 85%
Model training: 15% of time
Yet tutorials focus 90% on modeling!

Data cleaning nightmares:

Missing values in brand, model, year columns
Price outliers: ₹50 lakhs listed as ₹5 crores
Fuel type inconsistencies: "Petrol", "petrol", "PETROL"
Mileage formats: "20 kmpl", "20", "20.5 kmpl"
Manufacturing year: Some cars from "future" (typos)

Feature extraction challenges:

Extract brand from full car name
Calculate car age from manufacturing year
Parse mileage numbers from mixed formats
One-hot encode categorical variables
Handle rare categories (cars with <5 samples)

Models tested:

Linear Regression: R² = 0.68 (baseline)
Decision Tree: R² = 0.73 (overfitting)
Random Forest: R² = 0.84 (good!)
XGBoost: R² = 0.86 (best single model)
Voting Regressor (RF + XGB): R² = 0.87 (winner!)

Ensemble technique used:
Voting Regressor combines Random Forest and XGBoost predictions by averaging - reduces individual model variance
Streamlit deployment:

User inputs: Brand, Model, Year, Mileage, Fuel Type
Real-time prediction with confidence interval
Working app deployed successfully!

Key insight:
Real ML projects are 85% data wrangling, 15% modeling - tutorials teach the 15%, industry demands the 85%
The reality check:

Expected: Spend days fine-tuning hyperparameters
Reality: Spend days fixing inconsistent data formats

Tomorrow: Moving to next project while this one is live. Learning never stops!
Data cleaning is the real machine learning.
Models are just the cherry on top.
Question: What percentage of your ML project time goes to data cleaning vs model training? Be honest!
