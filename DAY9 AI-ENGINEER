ðŸŒŸ Day 9 of AI ENGINEER JOURNEY â€“ A Small Win That Felt BIG! ðŸŒŸ

Todayâ€™s win? Solving a challenging problem on Codewars. The task?

"Count the number of duplicate characters in a string (case-insensitive)."

Sounds easy, right? But the real test was doing it efficiently, cleanly, and understanding the WHY behind the solution.

After testing and tweaking, I wrote a function that worked and learned a lot in the process. Here's what I took away:

Key Learnings:
Sets: Theyâ€™re perfect for eliminating duplicates!

Loops: Nested loops are handy, but they can cause performance issues if not used wisely.

Logic > Syntax: Once you master the logic, the syntax becomes intuitive.

Mini Interview Tip:
How would you count character frequencies in a string? Try doing it without .count() or any libraries. Just use basic Python â€” think through the steps and convert them into code. ðŸ§ 

Current Mini-Project Stack:
Weight & temperature converters

Compound interest calculator

Shopping cart system

Student grade analyzer

A simple time counter

All CLI-based, created with Python alone â€” no fancy libraries. Just logic and practice.

Reflecting on the Journey:
Some days are slow. Some days are breakthroughs. Today was one of those breakthrough days, and I'm feeling proud of the progress.

Whatâ€™s Next?:
The goal? Become an AI Engineer by July 31. The process? Show up daily, learn, and level up one line of code at a time.
