Day 175 of my AI Engineer Journey
Today's implementation:
I learned Soft Margin SVM and the Kernel Trick - discovered why real-world ML needs flexibility, not perfection.
The process:

Coded Soft Margin SVM with slack variables
Tested different C values: C=0.01, C=1, C=100
Implemented RBF kernel for non-linear data
Watched 2D data transform into 3D for linear separation

What I learned:
Hard Margin problem: One outlier breaks everything. Real data is never perfectly separable.
Soft Margin solution: Allow some mistakes, penalize them:

Formula: (||w||²/2) + C × Σξᵢ
ξᵢ = slack variable (error for each point)

The C parameter trade-off:

C = 0.01: Wide margin, many misclassifications allowed (underfitting)
C = 1: Balanced - optimal for most cases
C = 100: Narrow margin, almost no errors tolerated (overfitting)

Kernel Trick magic:

2D non-linear data → can't separate with line
Apply RBF kernel → transforms to 3D space
Now linearly separable with plane!
Never actually compute 3D coordinates - kernel does it implicitly

Key insight:
Soft margin is all about balance - maximize margin while minimizing classification error through controlled misclassification
Tomorrow: Naive Bayes - the algorithm that assumes independence and still dominates spam detection.
Perfect separation is a luxury.
Real data needs forgiveness.
Question: Do you prefer strict rules with zero tolerance or flexible guidelines with controlled exceptions?
