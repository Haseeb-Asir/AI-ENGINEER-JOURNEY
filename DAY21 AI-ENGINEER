ðŸ”¹ Day 21 of 112 â€“ Python Projects + Interview Prep! ðŸ”¹

Today I shifted gears from just learning to building and reviewing!

ðŸ’» What I worked on: âœ… Created a desktop weather notifier using Python, requests, and plyer â€“ now I get live weather updates right on my screen!
âœ… Compiled and reviewed some of the most commonly asked Python interview questions to strengthen my problem-solving mindset.

ðŸ“– Resource I highly recommend: ðŸ”— Top Python Interview Questions â€“ GeeksforGeeks

ðŸ”§ Technologies explored:

Python APIs

Real-world mini projects

Notifications via plyer

Core concepts and interview patterns

Every project I build is a step closer to my goal of becoming an AI Engineer by Day 112. ðŸš€

ðŸ“ˆ Consistency + Practice = Progress!
