Day 153 of my AI Engineer Journey
Today's implementation:
I implemented voting ensembles and discovered the mathematical proof behind why they work so well.
The process:

Built hard voting classifier (majority wins)
Implemented soft voting classifier (average probabilities)
Tested both on real dataset with 3 base models
Solved celebrity problem and duplicate removal using stacks

What I learned:

Critical requirement: Each model needs >50% accuracy (below 50% makes ensemble worse!)
Hard voting: Simple majority decision
Soft voting: Averages probability predictions (often better performance)
Mathematical foundation: If individual classifiers predict with slightly greater than 50% accuracy and predictions are independent, ensemble accuracy far exceeds individual scores

Voting types implemented:

Classification: Majority voting or probability averaging
Regression: Simple mean of all model predictions
Weighted voting: Give more importance to better models

Stack problems solved:

Celebrity problem: Find person known by everyone but knows nobody
Duplicate removal: Remove consecutive duplicates in array
Pattern recognition: Stack-based string manipulation

Key insight:
Three 60% accurate independent models can achieve up to 75% ensemble accuracy through majority voting
The independence assumption:
Models must make different types of errors - training on same data can violate this assumption.
Tomorrow: Bagging and Random Forest - creating model diversity through data sampling.
Independent errors cancel out.
Correlated errors compound.
Question: Do you trust group decisions more when the decision-makers have diverse backgrounds and expertise?
