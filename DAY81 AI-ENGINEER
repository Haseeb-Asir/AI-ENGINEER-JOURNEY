📘 Day 81 Of Ai journey

Today I revisited one of the most critical skillsets in AI & machine learning:
→ Solving systems of linear equations, and
→ Understanding the power of eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and decomposition methods.

🧠 What I Explored:
🔹 10 Ways to Solve Linear Systems (Ax = B):

Graphical (visual intersection)

Substitution & Elimination

Matrix inverse

Gaussian Elimination – reduce to upper triangle

Gauss-Jordan – reduce to identity matrix

LU Decomposition – break into lower & upper (Ly = B, then Ux = y)

SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) – super robust!

Cramer’s Rule

Iterative Methods – good for large systems

Matrix Form with direct computation

🔍 Deep Dive into SVD:
𝐴=𝑈Σ𝑉𝑇

✅ U = eigenvectors of 
𝐴𝐴𝑇
 
✅ V = eigenvectors of 
𝐴𝑇𝐴
✅ Σ = diagonal matrix of singular values (square roots of eigenvalues)
Used in:
PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
Image compression
Recommender systems
Numerical stability in ML models
🔢 Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors:
✔️ Eigenvector = a special direction that doesn’t change, just gets scaled
✔️ Eigenvalue = scaling factor
Facts I memorized with logic today:
Sum of eigenvalues = trace of matrix
Product of eigenvalues = determinant
Eigenvectors of symmetric matrix → always orthogonal
Identity matrix → all eigenvalues = 1
Scalar multiple → eigenvalues scale too
Diagonal matrix → eigenvalues = diagonal entries
Transpose doesn’t change eigenvalues

📌 Why it matters:
Machine learning is linear algebra in action.
Eigenvalues help models understand directions of variance, remove noise, and compress data without losing meaning.
