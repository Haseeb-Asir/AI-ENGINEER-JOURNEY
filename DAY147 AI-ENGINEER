Days 147-149 of my AI Engineer Journey
Today's implementation:
After 3 days of electricity outages and apartment shifting chaos, I caught up on hyperparameters and completed all linked list operations.
The process:

Implemented sklearn LogisticRegression hyperparameters on real dataset
Coded complete linked list operations: deletion and searching
Tested performance differences between hyperparameter settings
Built all CRUD operations for linked list from scratch

What I learned:

C parameter: Controls regularization strength (inverse of lambda)
solver='liblinear': Best for small datasets
solver='lbfgs': Better for larger datasets
max_iter: Prevents infinite training loops

Linked List operations completed:

Delete from head: O(1) - just update head pointer
Delete from tail: O(n) - must traverse to find second-last node
Delete by value: O(n) - search then delete
Search by value: O(n) - linear traversal required
Find by index: O(n) - count nodes until position

Key insight:
Hyperparameters can make or break model performance more than algorithm choice itself.
Real-world interruption lesson:
Sometimes life forces learning breaks, but consistent fundamentals practice keeps skills sharp.
Tomorrow: Moving to new apartment, but planning to continue with sorting algorithms and model validation techniques.
Consistency beats intensity.
Small daily progress trumps sporadic marathons.
Question: How do you maintain learning momentum during life disruptions like moving or travel?
