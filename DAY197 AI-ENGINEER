Days 197 & 198: Project Deployed! 🚀

I'm excited to share my latest project, a complete WhatsApp Chat Analyzer, which is now deployed live on Heroku!

This was a fantastic end-to-end project, taking an idea from a Python script to a fully-functional web app. It's built with Streamlit and Pandas and is designed to handle large chat exports efficiently.

Check out the key features:

Top Stats: Get a quick overview of total messages, words, and media shared.

Timelines: See your chat activity over months and days.

Activity Heatmaps: Find out the busiest days of the week and hours of the day.

Leaderboards: See who the most active users are.

Text Analysis: Instantly generate a WordCloud and a list of the most common words (stop words filtered, of course!).

Emoji Analysis: See a breakdown of the most-used emojis in the chat.

The deployment to Heroku was a great learning experience in managing memory and optimizing Pandas operations to run smoothly on a server.

Building is one thing, but deploying is another. Thrilled to have this one live!
