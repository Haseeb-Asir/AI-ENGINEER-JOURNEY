📚 Day 84 Revision Mode!!!
As part of my revision,today I revisited some of the most essential topics in Probability Distribution
 jumping into practical coding and theory.

🔁 Topics I Revised Today:
🔹 Normal Distribution (Gaussian)
– Symmetric bell curve centered at the mean
– Governed by mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ)
– Used everywhere: nature, finance, and especially machine learning
– Standardized using Z-scores → Z = (X - μ) / σ
– Empirical Rule: 68%-95%-99.7% of data falls within 1, 2, 3 std deviations

🔹 Standard Normal Variate (Z)
– A special normal distribution with μ = 0 and σ = 1
– Helps compare datasets and calculate probabilities via Z-tables

🔹 Skewness
– Measures asymmetry of distribution
– Right (positive) skew = longer right tail
– Left (negative) skew = longer left tail
– Important for spotting non-normality and outliers

🔹 Kurtosis
– Measures "tailedness" of a distribution
– High kurtosis (leptokurtic): fatter tails = more outliers
– Low kurtosis (platykurtic): thinner tails = fewer extremes
– Excess Kurtosis = Sample Kurtosis - 3

🔹 QQ Plot
– Visual way to check if data is normally distributed
– If points follow a diagonal line, the distribution is likely normal
– Useful pre-check before hypothesis testing or ML modeling

🔹 Uniform Distribution
– All outcomes are equally likely
– Used in coin flips, random number generation, and ML tasks like
 • Weight Initialization
 • Sampling
 • Hyperparameter Tuning
