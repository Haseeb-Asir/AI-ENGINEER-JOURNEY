**Day 146 of my AI Engineer Journey**

**Today's implementation:**

I built a complete classification evaluation system and implemented linked lists from scratch.

**The process:**
- Coded precision, recall, and F1 score calculations
- Built confusion matrix analysis for model evaluation  
- Implemented linked list with node-based memory allocation
- Created insertion, traversal, and printing functions

**What I learned:**
- Precision: When false positives are dangerous (spam detection)
- Recall: When false negatives are dangerous (cancer screening)
- F1 Score: Harmonic mean when unsure which error is worse
- Formula: F1 = 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)

**Linked List breakthrough:**
- Dynamic memory: Only allocates what's needed
- O(1) insertion/deletion: Just update node references
- O(n) search: Must traverse from head to find elements
- Perfect for write-heavy applications

**Key insight:**
Arrays vs Linked Lists trade-off:
- Arrays: Fast read (O(1)), slow insertion (O(n))
- Linked Lists: Fast insertion (O(1)), slow read (O(n))

**Memory allocation reality:**
Linked lists use heap memory with pointers, while arrays use contiguous stack memory.

**Tomorrow:** Implementing deletion and search functions for linked lists, plus ROC curves for classification evaluation.

Choose your data structure based on your use case.

Read-heavy: Arrays. Write-heavy: Linked Lists.

**Question:** When building applications, do you optimize for read performance or write performance first?
