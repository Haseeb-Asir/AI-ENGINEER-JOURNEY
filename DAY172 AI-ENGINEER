Day 172 of my AI Engineer Journey
Today's implementation:
I coded KNN from scratch and discovered why the simplest ML algorithm is also the most impractical for production.
The process:

Implemented distance calculations for every query point
Tested K=1, K=5, K=50 on same dataset
Visualized decision boundaries
Watched prediction time explode on larger data

What I learned:

K=1: Overfitting nightmare (98% train, 65% test accuracy)
K=5: Sweet spot (85% train, 83% test accuracy)
K=50: Underfitting (70% train, 68% test accuracy)

The brutal reality:

Training time: 0.001 seconds
Prediction time: 12 seconds (for 10,000 points!)

Why KNN fails at scale:
Every prediction calculates distances to ALL training points. 1 million training samples = 1 million distance calculations per prediction.
Key insight:
KNN is a "lazy learner" - does zero work during training, all work during prediction. Exactly opposite of what production needs.
The curse of dimensionality:
Added 50 features to dataset. KNN accuracy dropped from 85% to 62%. Distance becomes meaningless in high dimensions.
Tomorrow: Naive Bayes - the algorithm that makes wrong assumptions but gets right answers.
Simple in theory ≠ practical in reality.
Elegant code ≠ scalable solution.
Question: Have you ever built something that worked perfectly in development but failed in production?
