🚀 Day 49 of 112 – AI Engineer Journey

I'm currently out of the city and traveling, but that didn't stop me from staying connected to my goals. ✈️💻

Today, I took time to revise key concepts I've learned so far. It's been a great chance to reflect and reinforce my understanding.

I'll be back to full study mode in 2 days, and I'm excited to continue building and learning with even more focus! 🔥
