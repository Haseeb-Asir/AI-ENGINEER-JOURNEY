📘 Day 71 CHI-SQUARE TEST:

I learned how Chi-Square Tests help us test claims in the real world, especially when working with categorical data:
🔍 What I Covered:
✅ Chi-Square Test for Independence
 → Helps determine if two categorical variables (like education & exercise preference) are related.
 🧠 Realization: Just because numbers look different doesn’t mean they are — Chi-Square tells us if the difference matters statistically.
✅ Goodness-of-Fit Test
 → Checks if a distribution (like die rolls) matches what we expect.
 📊 If reality and theory don’t match — we don’t guess — we test.
✅ P-Value Interpretation
 → Learned how p-values actually represent the strength of evidence. Low p-value? Reject the null. High? Not enough proof.
✅ T-Tests (Quick Recap)
 → Compared sample means, when standard deviation isn’t known.
 → One-sample, two-sample, paired-sample — each has its use.
 → Shapiro test helps check normality. Levene test checks variance equality.
💡 Key takeaway:
Stats isn’t about numbers — it’s about confidence. In our results, our models, and the decisions we make from data.
