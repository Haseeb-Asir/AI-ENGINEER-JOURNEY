Day 162 of my AI Engineer Journey

Today's implementation:
I tested all Random Forest hyperparameters and discovered how feature importance is actually calculated under the hood.

The process:
Tuned n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split via GridSearchCV
Implemented OOB scoring for validation without separate test set
Extracted feature_importances_ from trained model
Understood the mathematical formula behind importance scores

What I learned:

OOB Score: Uses ~37% of data left out during bootstrapping for validation
Feature importance calculation: Sum of Gini decrease across every tree when variable splits a node, divided by number of trees
Computed as mean and standard deviation of accumulation of impurity decrease within each tree
Scale doesn't matter: Only relative values between features

Feature importance formula:
For each feature:

Track Gini impurity decrease at every split using that feature
Sum decreases across all trees in forest
Divide by total number of trees
Normalize to get relative importance scores

DSA progress:

Solved array problems (brute force approach first)
Learning optimal solutions through practice
Moving to queue implementation next

Key insight:
Feature importance shows which variables cause the most impurity reduction when used for splitting - higher reduction means more predictive power.

Tomorrow: Deep dive into AdaBoost - the boosting algorithm that started it all.
Understanding the formula makes the output meaningful.
Not just numbers, but mathematical proof.

Question: Do you trust feature importance scores from models or do you validate them through domain knowledge?
