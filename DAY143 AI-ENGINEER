Day 143 of my AI Engineer Journey
Today's implementation:
I started my DSA journey alongside ML and discovered something mind-blowing about Logistic Regression.
The process:

Coded Perceptron algorithm first (simple classification)
Hit the zero-gradient problem: Y - Y_hat = 0 → no learning
Replaced step function with sigmoid function
Implemented full Logistic Regression with gradient descent

What I learned:

Perceptron: Works but stops learning after perfect classification
Sigmoid magic: Output between 0-1, never exactly zero
Probabilistic output: 0.7 = 70% chance of positive class
Continuous learning: Always adjusts, even when "correct"

DSA parallel:
Started NeetCode roadmap with Big O notation - realized ML optimization is just Big O in disguise.

Gradient descent: O(n) per iteration
Matrix operations: O(n³) complexity
Feature scaling: O(n) preprocessing

Key insight:
Sigmoid function solved the "learning stops" problem by ensuring gradients never become zero.
The beautiful connection:
ML algorithms need continuous improvement, just like optimizing code complexity.
Tomorrow: Testing Logistic Regression on real classification dataset and continuing DSA with array problems.
Sometimes the best solutions come from never stopping.
Even when you're already right.
Question: Do you prefer algorithms that stop when "good enough" or ones that continuously optimize?
