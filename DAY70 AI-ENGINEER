🎓 Day 70 of Ai Engineering:

Due to my midterms going on, I’m going slower but steady.

 Today, I explored the T-Test, one of the most commonly used tools in statistics and machine learning when the standard deviation is unknown and sample size is small.

🧠 What I Learned:

📌 T-Test is used to compare means:

Between a sample and population

Between two independent groups

Or between before & after data for the same group

All using Student’s T-distribution

🔍 Types of T-Tests:

One-Sample T-Test

 → Compare sample mean vs population mean

Independent Two-Sample T-Test

 → Compare means of two unrelated groups (e.g., Class A vs Class B)

 ✔ Requires equal variances → use F-Test or Levene’s Test to check

Paired T-Test

 → Compare before & after scores for the same group

 ✔ Common in training, treatment, or time-based studies

✅ Bonus:

I also learned about the Shapiro-Wilk Test for checking normality

 → p > 0.05 = Data is normal

 → p ≤ 0.05 = Not normal
