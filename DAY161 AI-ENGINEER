Day 161 of my AI Engineer Journey
Today's implementation:
I implemented BaggingClassifier, BaggingRegressor, and Random Forest - then discovered the subtle difference that makes Random Forest superior.
The process:

Coded BaggingClassifier with majority voting on iris dataset
Built BaggingRegressor with mean aggregation
Implemented Random Forest from scratch
Tested OOB (out-of-bag) scoring for validation

What I learned:

OOB Score: Uses leftover bootstrap samples for validation (no need for separate test set)
Optimal sampling: 25-50% of data per tree works best
Bagging > Pasting in most cases due to bootstrap diversity

Random Forest vs Bagging breakthrough:

Bagging: Feature sampling done ONCE per tree
Random Forest: Feature sampling at EVERY node split
Result: Random Forest has double randomness (data + features at each split)

Why Random Forest dominates:

More diversity between trees
Reduces correlation between models
Works well with minimal hyperparameter tuning
Lower bias AND lower variance simultaneously

Key insight:
Random Forest introduces randomness at two levels - bootstrap sampling for data diversity, and feature sampling at each node for decision diversity.
Implementation note:
Random Forest is essentially bagging with decision trees, but the node-level feature sampling makes it far more powerful.
Tomorrow: Hyperparameter tuning for Random Forest and understanding feature importance rankings.
More randomness means less correlation.
Less correlation means better ensemble.
Question: Do you prefer algorithms that require extensive tuning or ones that work well out-of-the-box like Random Forest?
