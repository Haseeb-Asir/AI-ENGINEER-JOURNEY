🚀 Day 113 of my AI Engineer Journey

Today’s big focus → Handling Missing Data (Categorical + Advanced Techniques)
And honestly… this step feels like the “silent boss battle” of ML. ⚡

Here’s what I learned (and tested on the Titanic dataset 🛳):

1️⃣ Mode / Most Frequent Imputation

Great when missingness is random & <5%

✅ Simple, fast, effective for categorical

❌ Can distort distribution

2️⃣ Missing Category Imputation

Instead of filling → create a new category called “Missing”

Best when data isn’t missing at random & >5% gaps

3️⃣ Random Imputation

Fill missing values with random samples from the same column

✅ Preserves variance

❌ Breaks correlation, memory-heavy

Works best with linear models, not decision trees

4️⃣ Missing Indicator Method

Create a new binary column (True if missing, False if not)

Helps models capture the signal of missingness

5️⃣ Automated Imputation (GridSearchCV)

ML itself finds the best imputation strategy

✅ Removes guesswork

❌ Computationally expensive

💡 Key takeaway:
There’s no “one-size-fits-all” for missing data. Sometimes the simplest fix works, sometimes you need to engineer missingness itself into a feature.

👉 What I love about ML is this: even what you don’t know (missing values) can become a feature that improves predictions.

Curious → Which missing data strategy do you find most reliable in real-world projects?
