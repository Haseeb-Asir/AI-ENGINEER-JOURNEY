Day 99 of My AI Journey
Today I dove deeper into real-world data handling and unlocked two powerful tools for modern data science: JSON and APIs! 🔍📡
✅ Learnt about JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) – how it's structured, how it's used for data exchange, and how to load/parse it effectively in Python.
 ✅ Explored important pd.read_json() parameters – like orient, typ, and convert_dates, giving me flexibility when working with semi-structured data.
 ✅ Took the leap into API integration using Python’s requests library!
 ✅ Successfully fetched data from a real-world API – the IMDb Movies API – and pulled a list of top movies programmatically. 🎬
🔗 This was my first experience turning the internet into my dataset—and it felt powerful! I now understand how dynamic data can be accessed and used to build models or dashboards.
