📊 Day 66 – Confidence in the Unknown

Today I explored what really shapes a Confidence Interval — that powerful statistical tool that helps us say, “We’re not sure of the exact answer, but we’re confident it lies between here and here.”

🔍 What affects the width of a confidence interval?
Confidence Level (e.g. 95%)

Sample Size

Population Standard Deviation (which we almost never know!)

When we don’t have the population std deviation (which is most of the time), we shift to the T-distribution — especially for small samples. It’s like the normal curve, but with heavier tails, and it uses a new friend:
→ Degrees of freedom (n – 1)

That’s why we use the T-table instead of the Z-table when the sample is small or uncertain.

🛳️ Meanwhile, I’m applying what I learn with real data:
In today’s Titanic dataset case study, I revisited fare distribution and began exploring statistical confidence around fare averages in different passenger classes — making theory meet practice.

🧠 The learning is slower due to midterms, but I’m still here.
It’s not about speed, it’s about showing up — even with half a step.
