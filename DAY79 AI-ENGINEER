ðŸ“˜ Day 79 â€“ Matrix Thinking Begins

Today I explored one of the most essential building blocks in machine learning: Matrices â€” through the lens of Linear Algebra.

From representing data to powering model computations, matrices are the language of modern AI.

ðŸ§  What I Learned:
ðŸ”¹ What is a Matrix?
â†’ A rectangular array of numbers that represents data, transformations, or equations.

ðŸ”¹ Types of Matrices:
â†’ Identity, Square, Row, Column, Zero â€” each with its own structure and role.

ðŸ”¹ Matrix Operations:
â†’ Addition, scalar multiplication, transpose, and especially matrix multiplication â€” which is everywhere in ML.

ðŸ”¹ Determinant & Inverse:
â†’ Key for solving systems of equations like Ax = b
â†’ Learned how to check if a matrix is invertible and how to compute its inverse using adjoint & cofactors.

ðŸ“Œ Key Insight:
What looks like just numbers in a box is actually a powerful structure that feeds deep learning models, helps in image transformations, and drives almost every layer in neural networks.

One more foundational layer locked in. ðŸ”“
