🚀 Day 35 of #AIEngineerJourney
Today marks the start of the real fun — I'm officially stepping into Advanced EDA & Feature Engineering! 🧠🔍

Up till now, I’ve been cleaning, exploring, and visualizing data… but now it's time to transform it into gold.
I started diving into the theory behind:

✅ Feature Scaling (Min-Max, Standardization)
✅ Encoding Categorical Variables (Label & One-Hot)
✅ Creating New Features (like Age Groups, Fare Per Person, etc.)

Today was all about building the foundation. Tomorrow, I’ll go deeper into practical application on datasets.
This part excites me because real machine learning begins with great features, not just models. ⚡

Stay tuned as I turn raw data into insight and intelligence!
