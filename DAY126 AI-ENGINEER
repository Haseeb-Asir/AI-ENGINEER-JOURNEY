🤯 Day 126 of my AI Engineer Journey
Today I did something that felt impossible 3 weeks ago... I coded multiple linear regression from scratch and got the EXACT same results as sklearn! 🔥

Here's what happened:
Yesterday I learned the math: β = (X^T X)^(-1) X^T Y

Today I thought: "Can I actually implement this?"
The Challenge: Build a class that matches sklearn's LinearRegression() perfectly.

🔍 The Moment of Truth:
My Model Results:

Coefficient 1: 0.7834
Coefficient 2: 0.5621
Intercept: 2.1445
R² Score: 0.8756

Sklearn Results:

Coefficient 1: 0.7834
Coefficient 2: 0.5621
Intercept: 2.1445
R² Score: 0.8756
IDENTICAL! 🎉

🤔 The Realization:
sklearn isn't magic. It's just really good math + clean code. The algorithm I learned in theory yesterday is the SAME algorithm running inside sklearn today.

💡 Biggest Learning:
Understanding the math first made coding 10x easier. I wasn't just calling functions anymore - I knew WHY each line of code existed.

Tomorrow: Diving into gradient descent.

Question: Have you ever coded a popular library function from scratch? How did it change your understanding of the algorithm?
