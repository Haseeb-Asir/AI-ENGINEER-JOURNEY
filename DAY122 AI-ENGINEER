📊 After 122 days, I finally understood why linear regression "just works"…

Today I dove deep into the mathematical foundation of linear regression — and discovered there are actually 2 completely different approaches to solve the same problem.

🔍 What I Did:
Implemented both closed-form and iterative solutions for the classic Y = MX + B equation, trying to understand when to use which approach.
💡 Key Insights I Discovered:
1. Closed-Form vs Non-Closed Form Solutions

Closed-form (Ordinary Least Squares): Direct mathematical formula → instant answer
Non-closed form (Gradient Descent): Iterative approximation → gradual convergence

2. The Beautiful Math Behind OLS:

M = Σ[(Xi - X̄)(Yi - Ȳ)] / Σ[(Xi - X̄)²]
B = Ȳ - M × X̄

3. The Error Minimization Magic:
Error function: E = Σ(Yi - MXi - B)²
Take partial derivatives ∂E/∂M and ∂E/∂B
Set both = 0 to find optimal M and B

🎯 The Action/Tool:
I visualized the error landscape as a 3D surface plot with M and B as axes. The "valley bottom" shows where our error is minimized — that's our solution!

📚 Resource I Recommend:
This Khan Academy derivation breaks down the partial derivative steps beautifully → OLS Mathematical Derivation

💭 The Bigger Picture:
This isn't just about fitting lines to data. Understanding closed-form vs iterative solutions is crucial for choosing the right ML algorithm. Small datasets? Go closed-form. Big data or complex models? Gradient descent wins.
🔥 Plot Twist: When I plotted the error function, I realized linear regression is actually an optimization problem in disguise. Every ML algorithm is just finding the bottom of some mathematical valley!

🤔 Question: When building ML models, do you:
👉 Prefer closed-form solutions for their mathematical elegance?
👉 Or trust iterative methods for their flexibility and scalability?
