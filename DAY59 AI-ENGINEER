Day 59 :Is Your Data Really Normal? 
Today I explored two key concepts that help us understand data shape beyond mean and variance.
ðŸ”„ Skewness
Skewness tells us if the data is asymmetrical:
ðŸ“ˆ Positive skew: Long tail on right â†’ mode < median < mean
ðŸ“‰ Negative skew: Long tail on left â†’ mode > median > mean
â–¶ Used for outlier detection, model assumptions, and testing normality.
ðŸ“Š Kurtosis
Kurtosis = tailedness of the distribution.
ðŸ“ˆ Leptokurtic: Heavy tails (extreme events)
ðŸ“‰ Platykurtic: Light tails
ðŸ”˜ Mesokurtic: Normal tails (like Gaussian)
In finance, kurtosis risk = risk of unexpected losses or gains due to fat tails.
ðŸ§ª Is My Data Normal?
Histogram â†’ bell curve?
QQ Plot â†’ points on diagonal?
Statistical Tests â†’ e.g., Shapiro-Wilk (check p-value)
These concepts go beyond theory as they guide real decisions in modeling and risk.
