📚 Day 87 – Revision with a Coded Approach | Statistics for AI
I’m continuing my full revision of AI Math & Stats, but this time focusing more on practical coding and real examples.

Today’s topics:

🔹 Inferential Statistics – making predictions about populations from samples
🔹 Point Estimate – single value approximation for unknown population parameter
🔹 Confidence Interval (CI)
  • CI = point estimate ± margin of error
  • Used Z-procedure (known σ) and T-procedure (unknown σ)
  • Learned to apply them in Python with confidence level logic and assumptions

🔹 Hypothesis Testing –
  • Null Hypothesis (H₀): no change, no effect
  • Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): claims a significant difference
  • Learned real-world examples like YouTube A/B format testing
  • Focused on logic, assumptions, and how to reject/accept hypotheses using p-values, alpha, and statistical significance

👉 Hands-on practiced with scipy.stats in Python
💡 Concepts are clearer now with data-backed examples.

Tomorrow, I continue with statistical tests & coded hypothesis testing!
