🚨 Most people misunderstand this about tensors...

Everyone thinks tensors = just "fancy arrays."

But here's the truth 👇

 I thought I “understood” tensors…

 Until I tried explaining the difference between 1D vector vs 1D tensor 😅



🎯 Day 96: Deep dive into Tensors (and why most get it wrong)

Here's what I learned:

✅ 0D Tensor → A single number (scalar)

 ✅ 1D Tensor → Vector → e.g. [1, 2, 3]

 ✅ 2D Tensor → Matrix → e.g. [[1,2],[3,4]]

 ✅ 3D Tensor → Stack of matrices (like color image RGB)

 ✅ 4D Tensor → Batch of 3D images

 ✅ 5D Tensor → Sequence of batches (used in video, NLP)



But here’s the twist:

 📌 A 1D tensor has rank = 1 (not 2!)

 📌 "Rank" ≠ "Shape" — Rank = number of dimensions/axes

 📌 Vectors might represent higher-dim logic, but mathematically, they're still 1D



🧠 Example that clicked for me:

Scalar: 5 (0D)

Vector: [2, 4, 6] (1D)

Matrix: [[2,4], [6,8]] (2D)

Image RGB: 28x28x3 (3D tensor)

Batch of images: 32x28x28x3 (4D tensor)



💡 Tensors power everything in deep learning , from images to sound to text.

Without understanding their dimensions, your model’s architecture will break.

🛠️ Visual Break Idea:

 Make a carousel of "From Scalar → to 5D Tensor" with real-world examples (number → list → table → image → video).
