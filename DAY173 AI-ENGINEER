Day 173 of my AI Engineer Journey
Today's implementation:
I learned SVM and discovered why it's called "maximum margin" - it literally finds the widest possible street between two classes.
The process:

Coded SVM from scratch with margin calculations
Visualized support vectors and decision boundaries
Compared different hyperplane positions
Tested on linearly separable and non-linear data

What I learned:

Random hyperplane → margin = 0.3
Adjusted hyperplane → margin = 0.7
Optimal hyperplane → margin = 1.2 (widest street!)
Support vectors = only 3 points out of 100 determine entire boundary

The geometric intuition:
Imagine drawing a line between two groups of points. SVM doesn't just draw any line - it draws the fattest possible line that separates them.
Key insight:
Only the points closest to the decision boundary (support vectors) matter. Delete 97% of your data, keep the 3 critical points - same decision boundary!
Why SVM dominated pre-deep learning:

Works on high-dimensional data
Robust to outliers (only support vectors matter)
Handles non-linear data with kernel trick
Mathematically elegant optimization problem

Linear Regression assumptions learned:

Linear relationship between X and Y
No multicollinearity (features independent)
Residuals normally distributed
Homoscedasticity (constant variance)
No autocorrelation of errors

Tomorrow: Kernel trick - how SVM handles non-linear data without adding features.
Most data is noise.
Only the boundary cases matter.
Question: In your work, do you focus on the bulk of data or the edge cases that define the boundaries?
