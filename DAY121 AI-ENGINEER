📈 Why do almost all beginners in ML start with Linear Regression?

Today I finally started the 6th stage of the Machine Learning Development Cycle — ML algorithms 🎉
And of course, the very first one is Linear Regression.

🔹 What I Did:
Explored the basics of simple linear regression — one input, one output.
Example: Predicting salary based on CGPA.

🔹 The "Aha!" Insight:
The magic lies in a simple equation:
👉 Y = MX + B
Where M (slope) = how strongly Y depends on X
And B (intercept) = the offset so Y isn’t forced to start at 0.

Without B → freshers with 0 years of experience would be predicted to earn 0 salary 😅 (not true at all).

🔹 The Action/Tool:
Plotted data points → fit the best fit line (closest to all points).
That line is found by optimizing M & B to minimize error.

📚 Resource I recommend: For visual intuition, check this blog: StatQuest Linear Regression Video
 — clear & beginner-friendly.

👉 (I also coded a simple regression example — drop a comment if you’d like the code snippet!)

💡 Lesson:
Linear regression may seem “too basic,” but it’s the foundation for understanding weights, bias, optimization, and loss functions — concepts that power advanced ML and even deep learning.

🎨 Visual Idea:
A scatter plot of CGPA vs Package with the regression line drawn through the points.

🤔 Question:
Do you think linear regression is still relevant in today’s deep learning era?
👉 Yes — it’s the foundation.
👉 No — it’s outdated and mostly theoretical.
