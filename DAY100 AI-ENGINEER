🎉 Day 100 of My AI Journey! 💯
A huge milestone—100 days of consistent learning, building, and growing in the field of AI & Data Science!

🚀 Today, I took a solid step into Step 2 of the ML Lifecycle: Data Gathering, specifically through Web Scraping 🌐🕸️

🔍 Here's what I explored:
✅ Learnt the basics of BeautifulSoup – how to parse HTML, find tags, extract text, and navigate DOM trees.
✅ Got comfortable with requests and combining it with BeautifulSoup to automate scraping.
✅ Practiced by scraping real company reviews and data from AmbitionBox – a powerful hands-on exercise to build datasets from scratch.
✅ Understood where Web Scraping fits in the ML lifecycle and how to responsibly collect data when APIs are not available.

📊 Data gathering is the foundation of every ML project—and today was a great reminder that real-world data isn't always neatly packaged. Sometimes you need to dig it out!

⚡ 100 days down. Many more to go.
