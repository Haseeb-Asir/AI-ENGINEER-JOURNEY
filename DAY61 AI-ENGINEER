âœ¨ Day 61 â€” Learning, One Bit at a Time âœ¨

Two months in, and Iâ€™m still showing up â€” not just for the algorithms, but for myself.

Today I learned how something as simple as a yes or no can build the foundation of powerful predictions.
â†’ A single decision: that's Bernoulli.
â†’ Repeating that decision over and over: thatâ€™s Binomial.

It hit me how often life (and data) is made up of just 1s and 0s â€” and yet the patterns we uncover from them drive email filters, A/B tests, even machine learning models.

Also explored sampling distributions â€” a beautiful reminder that even small slices of truth can represent the bigger picture, if chosen wisely.

No big wins. No viral posts. Just daily growth.
And thatâ€™s enough for now. ðŸ’»ðŸ“ˆ
