🚀 Day 19 Update: University Life + Python Progress! 📚🐍

University life has officially kicked off! 🎓 While diving into my classes, I’ve managed to keep my Python skills sharp and continue working on projects. Today, I focused on revising Python, problem-solving on Codewars, and I built a Voice Recorder project that captures audio and saves it as a .wav file. 🎤

Here’s what I worked on today:

Python Revision: Strengthened my core Python knowledge to keep my foundations solid.

Codewars Problem Solving: Solved challenges to refine my problem-solving abilities and Python skills.

Mini Projects: I built a Voice Recorder that records audio and stores it as a .wav file. This project helped me apply concepts like file handling and libraries in Python.

GitHub: I’ve been tracking my daily progress on GitHub to document my learning journey and share it with others. Check out my Python projects repository where I upload solutions, mini-projects, and challenges I’ve been working on! 💻

It’s been an exciting day of learning, coding, and project building, and I can’t wait for what’s next! Let's keep the momentum going!

Let’s connect and keep learning together! 💡YAYYY
